# The renderer test harness

The harness exists so the Rust rewrite (`docs/design.md`) has a fixed oracle: the same
corpora, run against the C renderer and against virglrs, producing comparable output.

The C leg is `third_party/virglrenderer`, at the rev `third_party/manifest.toml` pins:
`scripts/vendor.sh` fetches the source and `scripts/build-reference.sh` builds it into a prefix,
which the replay scripts take from `VIRGL_PREFIX`. Building it needs two host prefixes this
repository does not produce — an EGL-capable epoxy and the zink-on-KosmicKrisp Mesa — and the
script names them if they are missing. The Rust leg needs none of that. Its one
design rule is what makes it survive the transition — **it drives only the public C ABI.**
Nothing here may reach into renderer internals.

Three layers, in descending order of fidelity and ascending order of speed.

## Layer 1 — VM-level replay (`capture/`)

Capture a real workload inside a booted guest, replay it on both the accelerated backend and a
software reference, compare pixels. The highest-fidelity layer and the slowest.

- `capture-replay.sh` — glmark2 scene via apitrace over zink→venus.
- `capture-replay-shell.sh` — the real seated gnome-shell session; the closest thing to a
  desktop-correctness test we have.
- `capture-replay-vk.sh` — native Vulkan via gfxreconstruct, replayed against lavapipe.

These scripts drive a guest over SSH and were written against limina's boot scripts and fixture
paths; the paths need reconciling when the harness is wired up here. The knowledge in them —
which environment a capture needs, which replays silently fall back to llvmpipe, which oracle
actually distinguishes the backends — is the part worth carrying, and it is in the comments.

The reference leg is the oracle, not FPS: replays of the same trace on two backends can report
identical frame rates while rendering different pixels.

## Layer 2 — host-side replay (`replay/`)

Feed a recorded command stream straight into `libvirglrenderer.dylib` with no VM, no guest and
no hypervisor. This is the layer the rewrite is actually tested by, because it runs in seconds.

- `vrend-replay.c` — replays a classic-context stream: resource creates from the recorded
  arguments, transfer contents memcpy'd into synthesized backings, command batches submitted in
  captured order. Scores every colour offscreen at its unref — a content hash and an ink count
  per readback, in stream order — and every IOSurface-backed resource at end of stream, with the
  same `--score`/`--expect` contract as the venus side.
  Run it with `vrend-replay.sh <corpus> --renderer rs|c`, which supplies the zink-on-KosmicKrisp
  environment the renderer needs; `build.sh` alone builds it, pointing `VIRGL_PREFIX` at the
  implementation under test. Two switches bisect a score line that differs: `--until <seq>` stops the stream there
  and scores what the surfaces hold at that point, and `--readback <res>` on a resource still
  alive at the end reads its texture as well, so a scanout's surface and its texture can be
  compared — the pair disagreeing is how a stale surface read was told from a wrong render.
  `REPLAY_DUMP_DIR` (narrowed by `REPLAY_DUMP_W`) writes every scored readback and surface as raw
  BGRA, for `rgba2png.py` and a pixel diff.

  The snapshot-journal gate runs by default under `--renderer rs`; `--no-rebuild` opts out, and
  asking for it under `--renderer c` is refused (the C answers `-ENOTSUP` for the journal ABI, so
  it would report about the ABI rather than the corpus). It exports what each context retained,
  replays it into a context that never saw the stream, and requires the two journals to describe
  the same steps in the same order (positions are renumbered by the rebuild, so they are not
  compared).

  It is a fixed-point test — replaying a journal must yield a world whose journal is that same
  journal — and so it is the floor, not the ceiling. It catches an entry that fails to replay, an
  order that binds before it creates, a serializer that loses a shader's later chunks. It cannot
  catch a durable command the recorder never learned to keep: that is absent from both journals
  and they agree about it anyway. It also rebuilds only the end-of-stream world, and feeds the
  whole journal at once — so it never exercises the fence, the interleave where the VMM creates a
  blob partway through the replay. Only a real suspend/resume scores that.

  A drop is a finding, never noise: each one names the command and the fault, and is either a
  create the recorder failed to keep or a state the corpus reached. Never file one under "benign
  stale reference" the way the C's `drops_by_klass` does — the two are indistinguishable from the
  histogram. So a drop fails the run, and the only way to accept one is to pin it:
  `--rebuild-score F` writes the report — entries in and out per context, for each lost entry its
  kind, sub-context, size and leading dwords, which is where the object handle and the resource it
  names live, and the contents account beside it — and `--rebuild-expect F` requires that exact
  report. A corpus with no pin must lose nothing and must restore every resource's contents
  unchanged, which is where every corpus but `vrend-webgl` and `sampled` stands. The pin is a
  subsequence check, not a licence: a rebuild may lose an entry, never invent or reorder one, and
  a rebuilt journal carrying an entry the source does not have fails whatever is pinned.

  What earns a pin is a drop the guest caused. A guest that destroys a resource under an object of
  its own leaves a create no rebuild can replay, and the object is already unusable — binding it
  faults on the resource lookup whether or not a rebuild ever happened — so dropping it changes
  nothing the guest can observe. Two guest processes sharing a buffer reach that and one cannot,
  which is why the browser corpus is the only pinned one.

  The synthetic corpora score a resource by unref'ing it, so they retire their surfaces and
  sampler views first. That is not the gate being appeased: within one process a view holds a
  reference to the resource it names, so a guest cannot free one underneath it, and a corpus that
  did would be scoring a world no single-process guest reaches.
- `vrend-trace-decode.py` — decodes the same dump format for human inspection.
- `corpus.py` — the synthetic-corpus writer: the trace container and the virgl commands, shared
  by the `make-*-corpus.py` scripts.
- `make-blit-corpus.py` — writes a synthetic classic corpus that forces the shader blitter, for
  the gate no recorded session provides (see `fixtures/blit.score` below).
- `make-sampled-corpus.py` — the same, for the blits whose destination the sweep cannot read
  back; it scores them through a draw (see `fixtures/sampled.score` below).
- `make-surface-corpus.py` — writes a synthetic classic corpus that destroys a surface the
  framebuffer is still drawing through (see `fixtures/surface.score` below).
- `make-teardown-corpus.py` — writes a synthetic classic corpus that destroys a program and a
  sub-context while the renderer still holds them (see `fixtures/teardown.score` below).
  `--no-destroy` writes the arming control.
- `rgba2png.py` — turns raw readbacks into viewable PNGs.
- `rs/` — `vkr-replay`, the venus replayer. Creates each context, feeds the prologue journals and
  then the whole stream in execution order through the limina replay ABI, and scores the result.
  Run it with `vkr-replay.sh <corpus> --renderer rs|c`; it builds the crate and points the Vulkan
  loader at the ICD under test. `--score <file>` writes the score, `--expect <file>` diffs against a pinned one
  and exits non-zero, so `diff` is the whole comparison tool.

  The venus snapshot gate is the same fixed point the classic one runs: export a context's journal,
  replay it into a context that never saw the stream, and require the two journals to describe the
  same commands in the same order on the same rings. Sequence numbers are not compared — a rebuilt
  context numbers its own from one. It runs by default under `--renderer rs`; `--no-rebuild` opts
  out, and asking for it under `--renderer c` is refused (`journal_held` is a virglrs extension).

  **Where it runs is the difference between a gate and a green light.** A capture of a workload
  that exits carries the guest's own teardown, so at end of stream the context has destroyed
  everything it built and its journal is empty — a gate there finds nothing to compare and passes.
  So it runs at each context's last living moment, beside the memory census, which sits there for
  the same reason. `--rebuild-at <n>` runs it after the nth replayed command instead, which is the
  only shape a real suspend has: the guest still running, its world at its richest. Use it as well
  as the default, not instead: on `venus.vkrc` the two answer about different worlds, and a context
  whose gate says "nothing retained" is reporting exactly that rather than claiming a pass.

  A rebuild that reports "identical" is worth only as much as the replay behind it: two journals
  can agree about a world neither of them built. What makes the claim load-bearing is that a
  replayed command naming an object the rebuild could not produce is named in the log and fails
  the restore — so "identical" and "complete" are one answer rather than two.

  **A rebuilt world is blank, and the contents gate is what fills it.** A journal rebuilds the
  objects and the commands that made them, and says nothing about the bytes inside them — a resume
  that stopped there comes back to a desktop of empty windows. So the gate goes on to read each
  censused allocation out of the original context, `memory_write` it into the rebuilt one, and
  require it to read back as itself; the line says how many allocations it restored. It is here and
  not at end of stream for the reason the rebuild is: writing into a context that no longer exists
  compares nothing to nothing. What it can see is bounded by what the census can see — the pages,
  never an OPTIMAL image's private texels (below) — so on the synoik corpora the two IOSurface
  scanouts are the entries carrying real bytes and the rest agree at all-zeros.

  **The classic side does the same, and its blob is the C's.** A classic context's contents are
  every level of every resource attached to it, read back through the transfer path the guest
  uses; the gate exports them from the original context, scrubs the rebuilt one with the same
  bytes inverted, restores the capture and requires it to read back byte for byte. The scrub is
  the load-bearing half: classic resources are global and the rebuilt context is attached to the
  same ones, so a restore that wrote nothing at all would still compare equal. The blob layout is
  the C's entry for entry so that one parser scores both, and this was pinned against the C first
  — virglrs then reproduced it byte for byte on every corpus measured, deviations included.

  **A capture whose count is zero passes anything, and the pinned count is what stops it.** The
  scrub can only speak for a capture with bytes in it, so an export that returned an empty blob
  would sail through an unpinned corpus. What catches it is the `content N entries` line in the
  rebuild report, which a pin fixes; that is the lever, not an environment variable, and there is
  deliberately no `VREND_CONTENT=0` here.

  **`Z24X8_UNORM` does not survive the round trip on this stack.** Read back, written and read
  again, such a resource differs by one byte per texel — the same resources,
  the same offsets and the same counts under the C as under virglrs, so it is the GL path and not
  either renderer. It is pinned per corpus rather than excluded from the capture, because
  excluding it would be a behaviour change against the reference for a buffer every frame clears
  anyway. Its stencil-carrying twin `S8_UINT_Z24_UNORM` is in the same corpus and does not
  deviate, so this is that format and not depth as a class.

  **A planar level is skipped, and the composite corpora are where that shows.** A texture
  transfer moves one GL triple, so a decode target with its planes chained behind it has no
  readback -- 41 levels on `--ctx 10,11`, 6 on `--ctx 8,9`, the same in both renderers. Skipped is
  not the same as captured-empty: the entry is absent rather than present and zero, which is why
  the report prints both counts.

  **The third half is the sync state, and it is the one that decides whether the guest wakes up.**
  A rebuilt fence is freshly created and unsignalled and a rebuilt timeline sits at its create
  value, so a resume that stopped at the journal and the bytes comes back to a guest waiting on
  fences that will never signal -- the submits that would have signalled them died with the
  renderer. The gate exports the live context's sync state, restores it into the rebuilt one and
  requires a capture of the result to be the capture that went in.

  **What crosses is what the guest asked for, not what the GPU had got round to**, and that is why
  a snapshot here cannot fail. Work in flight is lost whatever is observed -- the journal replays
  creates and never submits -- so "this fence has a submit pending" is not a state a rebuilt
  context can represent, and the only self-consistent world to come back to is the one where
  everything already submitted has completed. That is a poll and a ledger lookup, never a device
  wait that could hang and never a refusal.

  **A sync gate can score nothing, and it says so.** `moved` on the report line is how many
  entries the blank rebuilt world disagreed with; a context that reports zero was compared against
  a world that already matched, and the fixed point passes whatever either half does. Measured:
  the synoik corpora move 1 at end of stream, `venus.vkrc` moves 0 there and 8 at
  `--rebuild-at 20000`, which is the run that scores this. The number is not pinned because gate
  results deliberately stay out of the score (`Tally::failed` says why), so a stderr line names a
  vacuous run on every pass instead.

  **The venus gate crosses the fence**, unlike the classic one. Part of what a journal retains is
  retained because a *blob*, not the guest, still holds what an entry made, so a rebuilt context
  with no blobs keeps strictly less and the two journals differ by the gate's own gap. So the
  replayer remembers every exporting `create_blob` a context is still holding, and remakes each one
  against the rebuilt context at the journal watermark it was first made at — `replay_upto` to that
  seq, create the blob, carry on. The watermark is not decoration: a guest may free an allocation
  later in the same journal, and a context replayed to the end first is then asked to export memory
  that is already gone. That is the interleave the fence exists for, and it is why the VMM's blob
  ops are ordered against a seq rather than replayed in a batch at either end. What no VM-free
  replay reaches is the guest half of a resume — nothing here ever reads back what those blobs
  point at.
- `rs/` also builds `venus-roundtrip`, the venus decoder's differential test. It decodes every
  recorded command with the Rust decoder, encodes it straight back, and compares against the bytes
  the guest sent. There is no C dump to diff against because there does not need to be one: the
  recorded wire IS mesa's encoder output, so a byte-identical re-encode is a diff between the two
  implementations over every command in the corpus. It needs no GPU and no ICD — run it as
  `cargo run --release --bin venus-roundtrip -- <corpus>`, which is a second and a half over the
  61 MB capture. Failure is per command: it names each command type, its outcome, and the first
  divergent offset, so one unimplemented shape cannot hide the thousand commands behind it. Both
  corpora reproduce exactly. It does not cover reply encoding — a recording holds requests only,
  never the bytes a renderer wrote back — and it tolerates the guest's padding bytes, which mesa
  leaves uninitialised and this renderer zeroes on purpose; the encoder reports exactly which
  ranges those are, so the tolerance is a set of offsets rather than a loose comparison.
- `rs/` builds `vrend-roundtrip`, the same differential for the classic decoder. A vrend trace
  dump holds every command the C dispatched, grouped by the submit that carried it, so the Rust
  decoder frames each recorded batch, decodes each command, re-encodes it and compares dwords:
  `cargo run --release --bin vrend-roundtrip -- ../../vm/captures/vrend.bin`, well under a second.
  Two things make it a gate rather than a smoke test. The C recorded only what it *accepted*, so
  a refusal here is a command a real guest sent and the C served -- a decoder stricter than the
  wire shows up as one. And the decoder is exact where the C is loose (a trailing partial element,
  dwords past the ones a command reads), because a decoder that ignores dwords cannot reproduce
  them and the comparison would be blind exactly there; `END_TRANSFERS` keeps the slack mesa pads
  the transfer prologue with for the same reason. All 13,726 commands of `vrend.bin` reproduce.
  Like `venus-roundtrip` it never calls a handler: it proves the wire is read where it lives,
  not what is done with it.
- `rs/` builds `venus-reply-oracle` for the half `venus-roundtrip` cannot reach. The corpus asks
  for replies and holds none of them, and those are two separate facts. The requests keep their
  `VN_CS_COMMAND_FLAG_GENERATE_REPLY` bit: 137 of venus's commands in 24 kinds and 64 of synoik's
  in 25 kinds ask to be answered. What no recording holds is the *answer* — a recording is the
  guest's side of the wire — and replay never produces one either, because both replay entry points
  call `vkr_replay_strip_reply` to clear that bit before dispatch. So the 326 per-command reply
  wrappers have no witness in the corpus and none from replay, and they are generated: one template
  mistake is 326 identical bugs, each reaching a guest as plausible garbage rather than as an
  error. The oracle encodes every recorded command's reply twice, once with the generated Rust and
  once with venus-protocol's own generated C renderer encoder, and compares the bytes. That C is
  ground truth because it is what every venus guest in existence decodes. Both sides encode the *same*
  `vn_command_*`: it is `#[repr(C)]`, so the C reads the memory the Rust decoder filled rather than
  a second construction of it, and nothing has to agree about filling. It needs the C toolchain, so
  it is behind a feature — `cargo run --release --features reply-oracle --bin venus-reply-oracle --
  <corpus>`. Every corpus matches on every command. A recorded command carries the guest's
  *request*, so its outputs arrive zeroed — and zero is the value that hides a content mistake,
  since two encoders reading different members of the same zeroed struct write the same bytes. The
  outputs are therefore planted with distinct values before encoding. Measured: a corruption that
  only perturbs non-zero payload bytes is caught on 449 of synoik's 1397 replies with the fill and
  331 without it. Still out of reach are chained outputs — the fill leaves `pNext` null, because
  planting one link takes the reachable type set from 42 structs to 235.
- The Rust renderer has a second, GPU-free gate on the same corpora: `vkr-replay.sh --renderer rs`. It drives the real ABI — context create, the replay
  feed, the decode loop, the object table — and every command is accounted for rather than merely
  parsed, which is what separates it from `venus-roundtrip`. Every corpus reaches `cmds N/N` with
  no `FAIL` line. What it catches is the layer between the bytes and Vulkan, and it caught two things
  already — a `VK_NULL_HANDLE` treated as a missing object, and every command after the first that
  named one.

  **It measures that a command was accounted for, not that it was carried out correctly.** Measured
  by sabotage against a build that serves the whole frame: every array accessor cut to hand its
  handler one element fewer than the guest sent replays both corpora at `cmds 506657/506657` and
  `1348/1348`, census unchanged — and KosmicKrisp's own workload counters (barriers, render pass
  starts, clears) come back byte-identical too, so the one host-side signal in the output cannot
  see it either. `venus-roundtrip` does not help: it never calls a handler or an accessor. What
  covers that gap is two layers of witness, and `harness/sabotage/sweep.py` is what says so.

  **The accessors are witnessed by generation, because the bug is in the template.** One template
  mistake is a hundred identical bugs, so `venus-gen` emits a test per command that plants its
  arrays, encodes with the real argument encoder, decodes with the real decoder, and asks the
  accessor two things: its length, and which member it read. Those are the accessor's only two
  degrees of freedom — and the second is not redundant, because where several arrays share a
  count that is all that separates them, and where they share an element type too (`pOffsets`,
  `pSizes`, `pStrides`) the type system does not. 52 commands are covered; the six arrays whose
  count lives in another struct, behind an out-pointer, or in arithmetic are named in the
  generated module, because a planter cannot establish both halves of those.

  **What a handler does between the accessor and the driver is witnessed by hand.** The seam is
  generated: `Device::plant_<cmd>` puts a plain function of the entry point's own shape into a
  proc table, `Driver::plant_device`/`plant_pool` stand that table up as a device a handler can
  record into, and `Driver::pool_child_id` reads the pairing back. See
  `a_recording_handler_hands_the_driver_what_the_guest_sent` for the four argument shapes and
  `a_pool_allocation_hands_over_the_run_the_guest_asked_for` for a run allocated from a pool,
  where the guest's ids, the driver's handles and the pool's record of both are three things that
  can go out of step with each other and nothing afterwards can tell.

  **A passing suite says nothing about what it would catch, so `harness/sabotage/sweep.py` asks
  directly.** Each entry is a one-line edit that makes the renderer wrong in a way a guest would
  see, applied to a clean tree, tested, and reverted; `RED` names the test that noticed and
  `SURVIVED` names a hole. Every edit asserts it matched, because a sweep reporting `RED` for an
  edit it never made is worse than no sweep. Add an entry with each witness rather than after.

  **The host memory budget is invisible to every other gate, and that is the point.** With no
  cap configured nothing is ever refused, so a replay scores identically whether the ledger is
  right, wrong, or absent -- byte-identical corpora are the proof the feature changed nothing a
  guest can see, and no evidence at all that it works. Its witnesses are the whole of its
  coverage: `an_allocation_over_the_budget_never_reaches_the_driver` (a refusal that arrives
  after `vkAllocateMemory` has already run costs exactly the memory the cap exists to save, and
  only the call counter can see the difference), `a_scanout_is_charged_for_the_pages_the_surface_took`,
  and `an_import_is_not_charged_because_its_bytes_are_the_exporters`. One sabotage that ought to
  be there cannot be written: a charge is credited by the record that holds it going away, so
  "a free forgets to credit" has no line to break. `sweep.py` says so where the entry would be.

- The layout oracle is the third leg of the same feature, and it runs as a plain unit test:
  `cargo test --features reply-oracle` in `virglrs/`. `venus-roundtrip` proves the wire and
  `venus-reply-oracle` proves the replies, but both compare *bytes*, and the reply oracle only
  reaches them by handing a Rust pointer to a C encoder. What no byte comparison can see is the
  memory contract underneath that — nor the one the driver relies on when it is given a `Vk*` we
  filled. So every generated type is asked for its offsets twice, `offsetof` against `offset_of!`,
  and the answers are diffed. It caught a real one on its first run: the model reorders a struct's
  members to put a length before its array, which is what the wire wants and not what the layout
  is, and `VkHostAddressRangeEXT` reached the driver with its address and size swapped.
- The video oracle is the same idea for the parameter sets the VideoToolbox backend synthesizes:
  `cargo test --features video-oracle` in `virglrs/`, which builds the C tree's serializers into
  the test binary and drives both sides from one script. These have no other reference — there is
  no conformance vector for an SPS we invented, only the bytes that have played — so agreeing with
  the C is the whole standard, and it is checked byte for byte rather than asserted.
- **A refusal is scored, not dropped.** The sweep used to write a line for a readback that
  succeeded and nothing at all for one that failed, so a port that started refusing what the
  reference serves scored byte-identical -- the one class of divergence the oracle could not see,
  and the one a hardening change makes real. Every refused readback now carries its resource, its
  extent and the errno, 2132 lines across eight fixtures. One line more comes from a probe: a
  transfer naming a handle nothing created, because no recorded guest ever asks for something
  refused with an errno rather than with the `-1` that means "cannot serve this readback", and the
  transfer entry points answer with a POSITIVE errno unlike most of the ABI. That probe caught the
  port answering -22 where the reference answers 22.

  The sweep does not ask for a planar resource as one RGBA texture. It is scored through its
  IOSurface plane by plane, the request has no answer, and the C refuses it by poisoning the
  context -- which dropped 893 later submits and replayed half the composite corpus into a dead
  context. A sweep must not manufacture the guest-hostile request it exists to observe the absence
  of.
- `fixtures/` — pinned scores, recorded from the C build. `vrend.score` scores 310 offscreens and
  5 IOSurfaces from the classic corpus: the stock guest's GNOME session with its wallpaper, which
  arrives as one 64 MiB transfer and is why the recorder's default capacity is 512 MB. That one
  transfer is most of what the corpus measures — the mip chain the guest builds from it with
  eleven blits, and the overview composited over it — so a recorder that drops it replays to a
  flat-colour desktop that measures none of this. `vrend-nodraw.score` is the same run with every
  `DRAW_VBO` dropped, and the diff between the two is the positive control: 19 offscreens lose
  their ink, and all three 1280x800 scanout IOSurfaces go from fully inked to one shared all-zero
  hash. An empty diff would mean the oracle measures nothing. `synoik.score` is the venus content
  fixture: its capture was taken mid-workload, so 22 device allocations are still live and half
  of them carry GPU-written bytes. `venus.score` and `synoik-lifecycle.score` are the lifecycle
  fixtures: vkmark runs to completion and the synoik session is stopped before its dump, so every context
  censuses zero at its destroy — a port that leaks a VkDeviceMemory fails there. The two synoik
  fixtures are one workload measured twice on purpose, and neither one can be the other: the
  census scores memory that is still live, so the corpus that proves teardown has nothing left to
  hash (`vm/README.md`). `synoik-glclient.score` is glmark2 on the synoik session: a Vulkan
  compositor compositing a *classic* client, so the GL contexts are skipped and the corpus can
  carry a C-recorded fixture rather than gating virglrs against its own previous build. Skipping
  them is also what makes four of its allocations imports that resolve to nothing — they name
  resources belonging to a context the venus replay never stands up — and both legs must refuse
  those. A leg that serves one instead censuses 26 allocations to the fixture's 23.
  `vrend-vkclient.score` is a Vulkan client under a virgl compositor, and it is the blob fixture:
  17 blobs, of which the stream types six as 500x500 `R16G16B16X16_FLOAT` render-target/sampler-
  views and leaves eleven untyped. It measures the import — a blob registered untyped, upgraded by
  `PIPE_RESOURCE_SET_TYPE` at its own point in the stream, and sampled downstream — and it
  measures the **pixels**, which is what makes the six lines worth reading. Their bytes are
  written GPU-side by the venus client and travel in no transfer, so the recorder reads them where
  vrend does and they replay from the capture: six fully-inked windows with six distinct hashes,
  one per recorded frame. Both legs must agree on all of it. **A blob replaying at
  `ink=0/250000` means the content records did not land**, and the fixture is then measuring only
  its own structure again — the failure to watch for, because a zero texture is a weak oracle
  where every wrong answer is also zero. The guest declares a stride of 4096 for a packed row of
  4000, so a leg that assumes packed rows shears every frame and says so in the hash. A mismatch
  says two renderers disagree and nothing about how: `REPLAY_DUMP_DIR=<dir>` writes the readbacks,
  and `rgba2png.py` renders the 8-bit BGRA offscreens while `half2png.py` renders a half-float one
  such as a blob window. Reading half floats as bytes shows noise, which looks exactly like the
  corruption one would be hunting.
  `vrend-vkclient-nofeed.score` is the same capture under `--nofeed`, and it is the fixture that
  measures the import itself. The recorded bytes still land in the backing store; what the replay
  no longer does is carry them into the texture. So what inks a window is the renderer reading the
  guest's pages for itself -- and both legs still score six fully-inked windows with the same six
  hashes the fed run gives. With the feed on, a renderer that reads nothing scores exactly like
  one that reads correctly, which is why the fed fixture alone cannot see this.
  **It covers one of the two shapes a blob's bytes arrive in.** The replay creates guest-memory
  blobs, so what it measures is the scattered iov; a blob whose bytes are a mapping this process
  holds -- minted shm, or the linear pages a venus allocation was published from, which is the
  production shape of a venus blob with no surface -- reaches the same fill through a different
  source and no fixture here runs it.
  `vrend-composite-h264.score` and `vrend-composite-vp9.score` are hardware decode into the
  **composite planar** target -- one NV12 resource with its two planes chained behind it, against
  the per-plane shape `vrend-vp9stock` holds. Both come from one capture on the enhanced guest,
  with H.264 and VP9 played one after the other in Showtime.

  **Showtime splits each playback across two virgl contexts, and neither half is the workload.**
  The player's GL context draws the video (`--ctx 8` for H.264, `--ctx 10` for VP9); its decoder
  runs in a context of its own (`--ctx 9` and `--ctx 11`), and that is where every
  `DECODE_BITSTREAM` and every bitstream upload lands. A player context replayed alone has its
  bitstream nowhere and every plane reads back zero; a decoder context alone fills planes that
  nothing samples. So both fixtures name both: `--ctx 8,9` and `--ctx 10,11`. `--ctx` takes a list
  for this reason, and the replayer keeps each context's commands in their own submit -- a batch
  handed to the wrong context is rejected wholesale as "Illegal resource", which reads exactly
  like the resource bug this replay exists to find. The way to find the pair in a new capture is
  to count `XFERDATA` records per context: the decoder's is the one holding them. Naming contexts
  is not optional -- the busiest is the shell's, and scoring it measures the desktop and none of
  the decode.

  **The plane lines are the decoded picture.** A composite target is an IOSurface-backed planar
  surface, which is neither a GL texture nor a BGRA IOSurface, so the sweep resolves it with
  `IOSurfaceLookup` and hashes it plane by plane -- and only the tight rows: the pitch is the
  allocator's choice and the surface id is the run's, so neither is scored. H.264 pins six DPB
  slots as 2560x1440 luma and 1280x720 two-byte chroma, VP9 thirty-five at 352x240 and 176x120,
  every plane inked and every hash distinct. Around the picture the fixtures gate 5018
  resources created with none refused, 334 IOSurface-backed, and the decode commands served to
  the end with no submit errors.

  **The conversion runs but its pixels are not hashed.** `convert_planes` fills a composite
  target's base RGBA texture from its two planes, and with both contexts in one pass it now
  executes -- six passes on the H.264 leg -- so a GL error or a crash in it fails the gate. Its
  output is still not scored, and the reason has moved: a composite target is read through its
  IOSurface planes, and its base texture has no readback route at all, because the resource's
  format says planar and every transfer read of a planar format is refused. Scoring it means the
  renderer answering "hand me this resource as it is sampled", which is an ABI question, not a
  harness one.

  `vrend-overview.score` is the GNOME shell with someone **typing in the overview's search
  entry**, and it exists because that one act allocates a resource no other corpus contains: a
  `PIPE_BUFFER` carrying `SAMPLER_VIEW | RENDER_TARGET`, a texture buffer. virglrs refused that
  shape, which killed the session on the first glyph -- and no pinned corpus held one, because
  every capture had been a boot and a workload and nobody had ever typed. The tier had nothing
  to do with it: it is the same GNOME on the same virgl driver on all three images.

  Recorded headless, because typing needs no window: `/tmp/type.py` in the guest drives
  `/dev/uinput` directly, so mutter sees a real keyboard and a capture can search for four words
  without a human in front of it. That is worth keeping for any corpus needing input.

  ```sh
  ./capture.sh video --renderer c --out overview --mb 2048   # then, in the guest:
  #   sudo systemctl isolate graphical.target
  #   sudo python3 /tmp/type.py firefox settings terminal files
  ./dump.sh vrend-overview
  ```

  It also carries 58 composite planar decode targets, which GNOME probes at 64x64 during boot,
  so it gates the composite target path against a build that cannot make one.

  `vrend-webgl.score` is a browser: Firefox in kiosk mode on `../vm/webgl.html`, three lit
  textured cubes over a procedural mipmapped texture. It reaches commands no other corpus does --
  `SET_SCISSOR_STATE`, `SET_STENCIL_REF`, `SET_SHADER_IMAGES`, `SET_SHADER_BUFFERS`,
  `SET_TESS_STATE`, `SET_STREAMOUT_TARGETS`, `CLEAR_TEXTURE`, `SET_MIN_SAMPLES` -- and it is
  replayed at `--ctx 2,9`, the shell and the browser together, because they share buffers through
  the compositor. The page must not ask for MSAA; `../vm/README.md` says why, and it is not a
  renderer problem.

  **It is the one corpus whose rebuild loses entries, so it is the one with a journal pin.**
  Replay it as

  ```sh
  ./vrend-replay.sh ../vm/captures/vrend-webgl.bin --renderer rs --ctx 2,9 \
      --expect fixtures/vrend-webgl.score --rebuild-expect fixtures/vrend-webgl.rebuild
  ```

  That pin also carries a depth deviation, which `sampled` carries alone — replay that one as
  `./vrend-replay.sh ../vm/captures/sampled.bin --renderer rs --expect fixtures/sampled.score
  --rebuild-expect fixtures/sampled.rebuild`.

  The five entries in that pin are sampler views ctx 2 holds over window buffers ctx 9 destroys —
  the compositor and the browser are two guest processes, and one's unref does not consult the
  other's views. Run it at the default single context and the score is still bit-identical but
  the rebuild is green on a world where the browser never ran, which is not the world the corpus
  is about.

  **Every readback asks at the format's own bytes per texel.** It used to ask at four, everywhere,
  under a belief written into the comment: four "is what every format this scores actually is".
  That survived seven corpora and died on the eighth, because a browser allocates
  `R32G32B32A32_FLOAT` render targets. The sweep then offered a stride a quarter of the minimum,
  vrend refused it, the refusal latched the context's `in_error`, and every later submit in the
  corpus was dropped -- 404 of them. What that looks like in a score is a renderer that stopped
  drawing, which is the expensive kind of harness bug: it accuses the thing being measured.

  The sizes come from `vrend-replay-formats.h`, generated by `gen-format-table.py` from the two
  files the renderer itself uses -- `virgl_hw.h` for the wire numbers, `u_format.yaml` for the
  block geometry -- so the harness and the renderer cannot drift into disagreeing about a format.
  Regenerate it after either changes; do not hand-edit it.

  A format that table cannot size -- compressed, or subsampled like `R8G8_R8B8_422_UNORM`, whose
  block is two texels wide -- scores `declined=block-size-unknown` rather than a hash. That is
  deliberate and is the same rule the planar YUV skip already follows: a request the sweep knows
  it cannot phrase is not a result about the renderer, and recording its refusal as `failed=22`
  reported the renderer's answer to a question the harness had asked wrong.

  **`vrend-av1.score` predates this and is stale.** It cannot be re-recorded here -- alface has no
  AV1 silicon -- so it must be re-recorded on couve before it means anything again.

  `vrend-shm.score` is the workload with **no GPU client in it at all**: a GTK4 terminal run with
  `GSK_RENDERER=cairo`, `GDK_DEBUG=gl-disable` and `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1`, so its surface
  reaches the compositor as a `wl_shm` buffer. The client issues no GL, and the corpus is
  therefore entirely the shell uploading and sampling somebody else's pixels. That inverts the
  usual balance and is the point of keeping it: `COPY_TRANSFER3D` dominates at 7760 against the
  browser corpus's 1532, and no draw target belongs to the client. Every accelerated corpus here
  measures the path a client's own rendering takes; this one measures the path taken when a
  client has none, which is what a guest without working acceleration falls back to.

  ```sh
  ./capture.sh vrend --renderer c --out shm --mb 1024   # then, in the guest, with the session
  #   env: GSK_RENDERER=cairo GDK_DEBUG=gl-disable LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 ptyxis -x ...
  ./dump.sh vrend-shm      # replayed at --ctx 2
  ```

  `vrend.caps` is the classic capsets, `virgl_caps_v1` and `virgl_caps_v2`, as the C fills
  them on this host: `./vrend-replay.sh ../vm/captures/vrend.bin --renderer c --caps FILE` writes
  them a field a line, and `--renderer rs` diffs the Rust side against the fixture. The guest's virgl driver
  configures itself from nothing else -- a format missing from `sampler` is a format the guest
  never creates, a wrong `glsl_level` is a whole feature set switched off -- and none of it is a
  pixel, so a score cannot see it. Three lines are expected to differ, all by design, and every
  one of them is this build declining to promise something it does not yet serve. **The capset
  is a promise, not a summary.** A guest reads it before it allocates anything, and the kernel
  has already handed it the handle by the time the host is asked -- so a host that advertises
  what it will later refuse does not degrade that guest, it poisons it for the life of its
  context. Advertising less than the C is therefore the safe direction and advertising more is
  never one; each line below closes when its path lands, not before.

  `num_video_caps`/`video_caps` carry only the profiles this build both has silicon for and has
  a decode path for. On a host with the silicon that is now the C's own six, byte for byte; a
  machine missing a codec's hardware reports fewer on both legs and still matches.

  `capability_bits_v2` is short `VIDEO_GUEST_PLANES` (1<<19), which the C sets on there being a
  decoder at all. That is right for the C, which writes the decoded frame back into the guest's
  own pages; the bit tells the guest that backing a decode target's planes with its memory is
  worthwhile, and a guest that took the offer here would export an honest-looking dmabuf fd
  naming a black frame. It turns on with the writeback, not with the decoder.

  `sampler` differs for two separate reasons. It carries the fourteen `ASTC_*_SRGB` formats the
  C's `ASTC_FORMAT` macro never registers (`virglrs/vrend-gen/gl_formats.py`), which is
  deliberate and permanent. And it advertises `NV12` where the C advertises `NV12` and `NV21`: a
  multi-plane format is samplable only as a composite decode target, the bitmask *is* the guest's
  permission to create one, and the surface behind one here is two 4:2:0 planes -- which NV12 is
  and NV21 is not, its chroma pair being exchanged within the plane, where no CoreVideo output
  produces it and no plane ordering repairs it. The C's own rule is the same one
  (`vrend_planar_target_backable`); it answers yes for one format more.
  A fourth line is a regression.
  `vrend-vp9stock.score` is VP9 hardware decode, 963 pictures through VideoToolbox, scored the
  ordinary way: the decoded planes land in guest resources and the sweep reads them back, so 240
  of the 243 decode-target resources carry pixels with a distinct hash per frame. It was recorded
  from the **stock** guest, which is the per-plane decode target -- one resource per plane, the
  shape a guest that never negotiates the composite planar target takes, and the shape the stock
  tier keeps. The enhanced tier's delivered mesa takes the other shape (one composite resource,
  planes chained behind it, one two-plane IOSurface), and that is a second contract needing its
  own corpus, not a newer version of this one.

  The corpus is `vrend-vp9stock.bin`, captured with `capture.sh vrend` while decoding
  `spikes/vt-vp9-decode/vp90-2-09-aq2.webm` from the limina tree -- a real conformance clip, not
  `videotestsrc`, which has no hidden frames and no reference management to get wrong. The decode
  is checked against `avdec_vp9` before anything is pinned: VP9 is normatively exact, so the two
  must agree byte for byte, and eight consecutive runs must agree with each other. A golden taken
  from one run of an intermittently faulting leg grades the port against a bad frame.

  `vrend-h264.score` and `vrend-hevc.score` are the parameter-set codecs, 300 pictures each
  through VideoToolbox, scored the same way -- and, like the VP9 one, from the **stock** guest and
  its per-plane decode target. What they add over VP9 is the whole synthesis path: the guest sends
  a parsed picture descriptor and slice NALs, and the SPS/PPS (and VPS) the decoder is configured
  from are written host-side out of the descriptor. The H.264 corpus also exercises the
  **session-preserving** path 290 times in 300 frames: `num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1` reaches us
  as the effective per-slice count, so the PPS bytes change mid-GOP, and a renderer that rebuilds
  the session there loses the reference pictures and decodes visibly wrong pixels from that frame
  on.

  A stock Fedora cannot reach either codec: mesa is built `-Dvideo-codecs=all_free` and the VA
  frontend refuses both in `vl_codec.c` before the driver is consulted, so no host advertisement
  gets through. The rig guest therefore carries RPM Fusion's `mesa-va-drivers-freeworld`, which is
  the route a real Fedora user takes for the same reason and which libva already probes ahead of
  `/usr/lib64/dri/` -- limina's `scripts/provision/install-freeworld-va.sh` does this to its own
  images, and the rig clone gets the same two `dnf install` lines by hand. `vainfo` naming a
  driver under `dri-freeworld/` is the check that it took.

  The clips are 300 frames of real screen content at 1280x720, encoded with four reference frames
  and a B-pyramid so the decoder has a DPB to get wrong, and the decode is checked against
  `avdec_h264`/`avdec_h265` in the guest before anything is pinned: both codecs are normatively
  exact, so hardware and software must agree byte for byte, and eight consecutive C runs must
  agree with each other.

  ```sh
  ./capture.sh vrend --out h264 --mb 1024        # then, in the guest:
  #   gst-launch-1.0 -q filesrc location=rig-h264.mp4 ! qtdemux ! h264parse ! vah264dec   #     ! videoconvert ! video/x-raw,format=I420 ! filesink location=/dev/stdout | md5sum
  ./dump.sh vrend-h264
  ```

  `vrend-av1.score` is 400 pictures across six clips, and it is **not scored on this host**: AV1
  decode needs M3-or-later silicon, so a machine without it advertises no AV1 and the corpus
  measures nothing on either leg. A change to what the sweep records therefore reaches it only
  when someone re-records it on that machine: a bulk re-record here cannot include it, and it lags
  the others until then. It is recorded and scored on the AV1 machine, against a rig
  copied there rather than rebuilt: the bundles are self-contained after `make-rig.sh`, the two
  renderer prefixes and the KosmicKrisp/epoxy prefixes are a few tens of MB, and only the guest
  disk is large. What the copy does need is the prefixes' own dependencies present at the paths
  they were linked against -- `install_name_tool -id` onto the new path so the replayer links
  what is there, Homebrew's `vulkan-loader`, `dav1d` and `spirv-tools`, and the *same* `libLLVM`
  the mesa prefix was built against, dropped beside it so `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` finds it ahead of
  the other machine's.

  The clips are limina's own AV1 spike set (`spikes/av1-obu-serializer/clips`), which is what the
  serializer was developed against: baseline, global motion, tiles, low delay, aom pyramid, pan.
  Two of the eight are deliberately left out. `superres` because **this build refuses
  super-resolution frames** -- the hardware returns them wrongly and there is no software decoder
  here -- so it would diverge by design. `filmgrain` because its hardware decode **is not
  reproducible run to run**: three consecutive decodes of the same file give three different
  md5s, which is a golden that grades the weather.

  **The reference decoder for AV1 is libaom, not dav1d.** `dav1ddec` tags its output
  `chroma-site=jpeg, colorimetry=bt709` where the VA path tags nothing, so `videoconvert` does
  different work on the two and every clip's md5 differs for a reason that is not the decode --
  which reads exactly like a broken decoder. `av1dec` (libaom) and `vaav1dec` agree byte for byte
  on all six.

  **These three are scored with `--ctx 8`, and that is not optional.** They were captured with a
  whole guest booted, so the decode is one context of four; the replayer with no `--ctx` picks the
  busiest, which is the console's, and scores 2317 empty resources and not one picture -- a clean
  exit, a full score file, and no measurement of the thing the corpus exists for. The context to
  name is the one holding `DECODE_BITSTREAM`. Six clips played one after another still land in
  one context -- GStreamer's VA elements share the render node's -- so six codecs' worth of
  create, decode and destroy score as one run.

  **A resource is zeroed when it is created, so a score line is the renderer's answer and not
  its allocator's.** A texture's contents are undefined until something writes them, and this
  driver does not zero them, so an unwritten resource reads back whatever the last tenant of that
  GPU memory left -- deterministic per renderer and different between them, which grades the
  allocation history rather than the port. This corpus is where it surfaced: the guest allocates
  224 decode-target planes it never decodes into, and the two renderers disagreed on 22 of them
  while agreeing on all 963 decoded pictures. The replayer now writes zeros over each new
  resource through exactly the call shape the score reads it with, so the untouched case is
  defined and identical. Measured before adopting it: not one line moves on `vrend`, `blit`,
  `sampled` or `surface`, so it disturbs nothing any renderer actually draws. `--no-zero-new`
  turns it off, which is how to look at what was there instead -- never record a golden that way.

  `vrend-shaders.txt` is the classic corpus's shaders as the C saw them: for each of the 33
  shaders created, `tgsi_dump` of the tokens the C parsed from the guest's text and the GLSL
  `vrend_convert_shader` emitted. It is the shader translator's differential -- a score compares
  pixels, which cannot say *which* line of a 200-line shader went wrong; the GLSL can. It is
  recorded with `vm/prefix-debug` (a `-Db_ndebug=false` build of the C; the release prefix
  compiles the dump out) as
  `VREND_DEBUG=shader ./vrend-replay.sh ../vm/captures/vrend.bin --renderer c`,
  normalised by `vrend-shader-log.py`. The Rust tests in `virglrs/src/vrend/tgsi/fixture.rs`
  read it and hold the parser to the TGSI half: every dump parses and prints back byte for
  byte; those in `virglrs/src/vrend/shader/glsl/mod.rs` hold the translator to the GLSL half.
  The fixture cannot say which *key* a block was translated under, so the live differential is
  the same replay against the Rust prefix with `VIRGLRS_DEBUG=shader`, normalised by the same
  script: the two logs must diff empty, block for block and in order, which holds the key
  construction to the C as well as the translation. Under `--nodraw` that is the 16 blocks of
  shader creation and `LINK_SHADER`; with draws it is all 33, the seventeen more being the
  variants selected at draw time.
  `blit.score` is the shader blitter's gate, and it is synthetic on purpose: no recorded session
  reaches the blitter at all. A desktop's blits are format-matched mip-chain reductions, which
  take `glBlitFramebuffer`, so a blitter could be ported, get every other fixture in this tree
  green, and have been measured by none of them. `make-blit-corpus.py` writes
  `vm/captures/blit.bin` — five blits, each a destination only the blitter can fill, four by a
  swizzle disagreement between an X-channel format and its A-channel twin and one by the red/blue
  swap an IOSurface-backed BGRA scanout forces. Its own comments carry which variants exist and
  why the depth-writing ones do not. The corpus is generated rather than recorded, so it is
  reproducible from the script and the score is pinned from the C the same way as the rest.
  `sampled.score` covers what `blit.score` cannot. The sweep reads back only a plain 2D colour
  offscreen, so a blit into a layer of an array — or out of one slice of a 3D texture — has no
  line in any score and would replay green having measured nothing. `make-sampled-corpus.py`
  writes `vm/captures/sampled.bin`, which SAMPLES each such destination in a draw whose own
  destination the sweep does read. The oracle is deliberately a different mechanism from the one
  under test: a blit that writes the wrong layer, read back by a copy that reads the wrong layer,
  hashes exactly like a correct pair, whereas a draw naming its layer in a texture coordinate
  shares nothing with the blitter's attachment path. Every layer the corpus does not blit into
  carries its own fill, so a stray blit is visible from the untouched end too.
  **`sampled.score` is the one fixture pinned from virglrs and not from the C.** Its last three
  lines draw twice through one sampler view with a blit between, and the two implementations
  disagree: virglrs returns the same pixels both times, the C's second read comes back
  byte-identical to the blit's destination — the blitter's own texture parameters, reaching a draw
  that never asked for them. Two identical draws with nothing between them have one correct
  answer, so the C is the wrong golden here; reproducing its bug to keep a fixture green is not a
  trade worth making, and a permanently red line is a gate nobody reads. The deviation is in
  `docs/design.md`; every other line of this fixture, and every other fixture in the tree,
  is still pinned from the C. **A bulk re-record overwrites that line with the C's answer**, and
  it is one line in a fixture nobody rereads, so restore it deliberately afterwards -- the value
  to restore is the one `res=52` carries, because the whole point is that the two reads agree.
  The last two lines are the depth-writing blit, which takes the blitter's other fragment
  shader — `gl_FragDepth` instead of a colour, and the depth attachment instead of colour
  attachment 0. Two disagreeing depth formats force it off `glBlitFramebuffer`, and the Z mask
  keeps it off the copy path. The blitted depth is sampled into a colour target, and so is the
  blit's SOURCE through the same shader and the same view shape, so a wrong number in the
  destination cannot be blamed on the depth sampling path.
  `surface.score` gates a surface's lifetime against its framebuffer. A guest may destroy a
  surface it has bound, and the C's framebuffer holds a reference: the attachment goes on taking
  pixels until the next `SET_FRAMEBUFFER_STATE`. No recorded session does this — a desktop unbinds
  before it destroys — so the ordering that matters is never sampled, and a renderer that deletes
  the surface's texture view at `DESTROY_OBJECT` scores green everywhere else. `surface.bin`
  destroys a bound surface and then CLEARS to a flat colour, over a resource pre-filled with a
  pattern, so a clear that lands nowhere is a different hash from one that lands and neither is
  uninitialised storage. Its second case destroys the surface, creates another under the same
  handle, and rebinds: a slot that compared handles rather than descriptions would answer "already
  bound" and skip re-attaching a different texture. Its third frees the resource under a bound
  surface and clears again into a second colour buffer, which is what reads back once the first is
  gone. The attachment survives on its own -- deleting a texture releases its name, not the object
  an attachment still holds -- so what this case actually scores is everything the renderer does
  *around* the freed resource: a readback must put the framebuffer binding back the way it found
  it, and a clear must already know its colour fixup rather than ask a resource that is no longer
  there. Still unmeasured: *re-binding* a surface whose resource was freed, which the C serves from
  its refcount and this tree refuses.

  `teardown.score` gates two lifetimes a real guest reaches constantly and no oracle here was
  watching: a program destroyed out from under the one that is bound, and a sub-context destroyed
  while it is current. Mesa gives every `pipe_context` its own sub-context and destroys it on
  teardown, and every shader state deletion encodes `DESTROY_OBJECT`/`SHADER`, so every recorded
  corpus and every boot test drives both paths — many times over. **Reaching a path is not
  exercising its invariant.** What none of them selects for is the ORDERING that makes a wrong
  answer visible, and without it a renderer that mishandles either one draws something plausible.

  So the corpus builds the ordering deliberately. Three programs are linked in stream order by
  drawing once through each of three fragment shaders, each writing its own constant colour; the
  MIDDLE one is then bound, and the FIRST one's shader destroyed. Destroying a program shifts
  every program after it down one, so a renderer holding a bare index now names the program that
  was *after* the bound one — `res=13` is the draw that follows, with nothing rebound, and it must
  carry the middle colour. The middle slot is the whole design: with two programs a stale index
  runs off the end and crashes, and a crash is the easy half to get right. A bound shader would
  not do either — its slot takes ownership and the programs are never released, so the corpus
  destroys an unbound one.

  Its second case makes a second sub-context current, gives it its own shaders (objects are
  per-sub, so it shares nothing), and destroys it while it is current. `res=15` is drawn
  afterwards with nothing bound at all, so what it carries is whatever sub-context 0 still held —
  which says both that 0 came back and that its state came back with it.

  **The corpus is armed, and that is recorded here because a corpus that stops covering its gate
  reads exactly like one that passes.** `--no-destroy` establishes the property the score leans
  on: the three programs' colours land as three distinct hashes (`res=10`, `11`, `12`), so
  "drew the wrong program" is a different hash and not an invisible one. It is not a differential
  — a correct renderer scores both arms identically, because the draw after the destroy carries
  the middle colour either way. What proves the gate live is removing the two fixes and watching
  it fail: without the index shift the replay aborts on `a program slot outlived the program it
  named`, and without the sub-context retire `res=15` comes back carrying the second
  sub-context's colour, **exit 0 and no error line** — a silent wrong answer, which is the class
  this corpus exists for.

  Replay it as `./vrend-replay.sh ../vm/captures/teardown.bin --renderer rs --ctx 1 --expect
  fixtures/teardown.score --rebuild-expect fixtures/teardown.rebuild`. The corpus holds one
  context, so `--ctx 1` is what it would pick anyway; it is written out because a score recorded
  under a different selection is not this gate.

  `teardown.score` is the C's, recorded from `--renderer c` and byte-identical to the Rust leg's
  — so unlike `sampled.score` this one carries no deviation. Its `.rebuild` pin is necessarily
  the Rust leg's, because the snapshot-journal gate runs only under `--renderer rs`. That pin
  holds a rebuild that loses nothing, which is not why the other two exist: it is here because
  the journal walks the sub-contexts, so a corpus that creates and destroys one is where a
  wrong walk would show.
- `vkr-record-decode.py` — decodes a venus full-stream capture (`--check` validates a capture
  structurally before it is pinned as a fixture, and reports how many records were recorded out of
  execution order — see the ordering rule in `src/venus/vkr_record.h`).

## The C tree's own tests (`ctests/`)

The C carries a `check`-based unit suite in `third_party/virglrenderer/tests/`, and it reaches the
one thing nothing else here does: **the ABI's error contract.** Every corpus in this tree is a
recording of a well-behaved guest, so no fixture passes a null pointer, an out-of-range callbacks
version or a second `virgl_renderer_init`. Those tests do almost nothing else, and both
implementations serve the same ABI, so the same binaries score both legs.

`build.sh` builds them and `ctests.sh [c|rs|diff]` runs them. `diff` is the gate.

**Neither leg passes, and a green is not the goal.** The C fails 45 assertions here for reasons
that belong to the host: zink-on-KosmicKrisp advertises no cube map arrays, and multisample
targets are refused. So the oracle is agreement with the C, the same rule every fixture follows.

**The gate is ONE entry, not the whole diff** — `fixtures/first-divergence.txt`, the first place
the two ordered failure lists differ, recorded with `ctests.sh diff --record`. Under `CK_FORK=no`
(below) a divergence cascades: the case that diverges leaves the process in a state every later
case inherits, so one cause prints as hundreds of differing lines. Pinning all of them would pin
the consequences, and touching the cause would rewrite the whole fixture into a diff nobody could
read. The first entry is the only line that is a finding, and it moves for exactly two reasons: a
new divergence before the known one, or the known one going away. Both want a human.

What it currently holds is the deviation this renderer chose: `virgl_init_egl` hands
`virgl_renderer_init` a v1 callbacks struct, and virglrs requires v3, where the C accepts v1. v3
introduced `write_context_fence`, without which venus fences never retire, and serving a caller
whose fences can never retire is worse than refusing it at the door. Everything after that line in
the full lists is that one refusal cascading.

Armed by reintroducing the bug the suite found — dropping the upper bound on the callbacks version
in `ffi.rs` — which moves the pin back to `virgl_init_cbs_wrong_ver` and fails the gate.

Four things about the setup are not guessable, and each one silently produces a wrong answer:

**The rs leg is a rewritten load command, not an environment variable.** `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` does
not redirect these binaries -- they load `@rpath/libvirglrenderer.1.dylib` and dyld resolves it
from their own `LC_RPATH` whatever the environment says. Measured: a deliberately corrupt
`libvirglrenderer.1.dylib` placed on `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` is ignored and the test still passes. A
differential built on that env var runs the C on both legs and agrees perfectly while measuring
nothing -- which is what it looked like the first time. `build.sh` uses `install_name_tool` and
asserts the rewrite landed.

**Two of the seven tests cannot score virglrs.** `test_virgl_strbuf` and `test_virgl_journal` load
no `libvirglrenderer` at all -- 0 dylib loads, 0 imported `virgl_renderer_*` symbols -- and
exercise static code from the C tree. They run on the C leg only, because counting them would pad
the score with two tests that cannot disagree.

**`CK_FORK=no` is required, and it costs isolation.** `check` forks a child per test case;
MTLCompilerService is an XPC service and an XPC connection does not survive `fork()`, so every GPU
test dies at `MTLLibrary` creation with "Unable to reach MTLCompilerService" -- which reads like a
driver fault and is not one. Without the fork, state leaks between cases in one process, so a case
that leaves the renderer initialized fails every case after it. **Read a divergence from the first
differing case**; the rest are consequences.

**`test_virgl_gbm_resources` is excluded permanently.** It references `gbm`, the minigbm
allocation path, which does not exist on macOS -- it fails to link, not to pass. It also does not
compile without help: `tests/meson.build` gives it `test_depends`, which carries no epoxy, while
`fuzzytest_depends` beside it does. Linux masks that by keeping epoxy in `/usr/include`.

Tests are built into `harness/vm/build-tests` and never into `harness/vm/build`: `-Dtests=true`
sets `ENABLE_TESTS`, which reaches the library, and `harness/vm/build` is the C leg every golden
in `fixtures/` was recorded from.


**Replay cannot reach the ring transport, so a seated boot is not a redundant gate.** The transport
commands drive a ring rather than travel on one, and every one of them is out of replay's reach --
by two distinct mechanisms, neither of which more replayer work would close.

`vkExecuteCommandStreamsMESA` is never recorded. It dispatches the commands it carries through the
same tee the recorder sits on, so writing the outer command as well would apply its contents twice
on replay (`src/venus/vkr_journal.c`). A corpus holds the flattened contents; the command itself
appears in none, so there is nothing to drive.

The `RING_FLOW_CONTROL` set -- `vkNotifyRingMESA`, `vkSubmitVirtqueueSeqnoMESA`,
`vkWaitVirtqueueSeqnoMESA`, `vkWaitRingSeqnoMESA` -- *is* recorded, and the replayer skips it on
purpose. Replay hands each command straight to the dispatcher with no ring buffer behind it, so
head, tail and seqno never move: a command meaning "the buffer advanced" is meaningless and a wait
on a seqno nothing will write blocks forever.

So a build can score every corpus perfectly and still refuse the first thing a live guest asks.
Replay stays the fine-grained oracle; booting is the only thing that scores the transport.

Corpora come from vrend's in-memory tracer (`LIMINA_VREND_TRACE=<MB>`) for classic contexts, and
from the venus recorder (`LIMINA_VKR_RECORD=<MB>`, `src/venus/vkr_record.[ch]`) for venus. Both
dump on demand through a FIFO rather than on a timer, so asking for a capture costs the render
path nothing until it happens.

The corpora live in `vm/captures/`, and they are NOT in git: `vm/.gitignore` tracks only the
scripts and the README, so nothing there can be committed by accident. The same holds for
everything else `vm/` needs — the guest disks in `disks/` and the two rig bundles beside them,
which are self-contained and carry the renderer they were built with inside. All three layers run
from this repository alone, against the C in `third_party/virglrenderer` and the build of it in
`vm/build`.

**A missing corpus fetches itself.** `replay/corpora.toml` pins every one by the sha256 of its
uncompressed bytes — which is what a score was recorded against — and `scripts/fetch-corpora.sh`
materializes them from a release, verifying each before it lands. Both replay scripts call it when
a corpus under `vm/captures/` is absent, so a fresh checkout runs the suite without a manual step;
a path anywhere else keeps the plain "no such file", because a typo should not become a download.
`--list` and `--verify` answer what is present and whether it is still the pinned bytes.

The four synthetic corpora are not hosted at all. `make-blit-corpus.py` and its three siblings are
deterministic — measured 2026-09-08, two runs of each reproduce the stored file byte for byte — so
the manifest records the generator and fetching one runs it.

`scripts/pack-corpora.sh` prepares a release: zstd, and the manifest. The compression is what makes
this practical rather than clever — 4.9 GB of recordings pack to 85 MB, because a command stream
over mostly-repetitive pixel data is what they are. **One corpus generation, one new tag.** An
asset replaced under an existing tag would leave every checkout that already fetched it holding
different bytes under the same name, and the scores would go on passing against whichever copy a
machine happened to have.

Recapture with `vm/capture.sh` (see `vm/README.md`); the pinned scores here only regress against
the corpus they were recorded from.

**Run a leg from this tree, never from the C's copy of this harness.** That copy is older and its
`--renderer rs` resolves the Rust prefix to the C tree's own, so it scores the reference twice and
reports a clean pass for a renderer it never ran -- the failure `vkr-replay.sh`'s header warns
about, reached by being in the wrong directory rather than by forgetting the flag.

### The IOSurface leg

IOSurface is the macOS dma-buf and the whole present path. vrend renders *into* the display
surface — it is wrapped as an `EGL_IOSURFACE_LIMINA` EGLImage, so the framebuffer's storage IS the
surface — and venus imports the guest image as an `MTLTexture` over one. So `transfer_read_iov`
and `read_iosurface` are not two views of one thing; they are different paths, and a port can get
either right while getting the other wrong.

Classic scores the surface itself: `sync_iosurface` (a classic-only blit-and-wait — a venus blob
renders into its surface directly and must never be synced), then `read_iosurface`, hashed. It is
scored at END of stream because a capture never unrefs its scanout: the opposite end of the run
from the colour offscreens, each read at the last moment it is both complete and still alive.

Venus scores only a count of backed blobs. `read_iosurface` takes a byte stride and a row count,
and the venus corpus carries no geometry — dimensions live in `SET_SCANOUT_BLOB`, a virtio-gpu
control command, while the stream records ring traffic. Recording scanout geometry beside it is
what would unlock hashing venus frames, and it is the only Layer 2 oracle for venus pixels there
can be: a zero-copy scanout blob has no `transfer_read` at all.

**No score contains an IOSurface id.** An id is host-private, recycled the instant its surface
dies, and free to change across a snapshot restore. What a port owes is that a resource is backed
and what its surface contains.

### What the venus score is, and is not

It scores RENDERER STATE, not pixels. A VM-free replay has no scanout and presents no frames, so
what it compares is the accept counts and the contents of the device memory the commands left
behind. That is the right target for the rewrite: a port gets object lifetimes, descriptor writes
and memory bindings wrong long before it gets a colour space wrong. The census deliberately
excludes map_ptr-exported blobs — those are the VMM's mapped-blob capture and are already
host-mapped — so what gets hashed is GPU-produced state plus allocations nothing has written.

**A zero hash is a fact about the driver, not a failed read.** Metal cannot back a tiled image
with imported host memory: KosmicKrisp's own allocations are MTLHeaps with a whole-span buffer, a
host-pointer import can make no heap, and a tiled plane over heap-less memory is given a separate
private bo. So an OPTIMAL image bound to memory this renderer minted renders correctly while the
imported pages stay blank, and `vkMapMemory` does not reach the texels either.

Which allocations that can still happen to is decided at `vkAllocateMemory`. An allocation the
guest **declared** for export is minted pages -- that is where cross-context import is measured,
a compositor sampling a client's window through them -- so a declared export over an OPTIMAL
image hashes as N zero bytes, and says so on the capture rather than being silent. An
**undeclared** host-visible allocation is the driver's own memory, mapped once and owned by this
renderer, so the census reads whatever the driver wrote, tiled or not.

That split is what the score measures, and it is a VM-free replay that measures it: nine census
entries in each synoik corpus carry content that used to hash as the empty constant. Re-recorded
2026-09-08, `synoik.score` and `synoik-glclient.score` moved on those nine and nothing else, both
legs agree on every one of the new values, and neither corpus reports an all-zero capture any
more. Before it, measured 2026-09-06, `synoik` scored 20 of 22 entries as zeros and
`synoik-glclient` 21 of 23, every one of the 41 an OPTIMAL image. The four that always carried
data are the 4 MiB scanouts, which are not read through pages at all -- their backing is an
IOSurface and `Surface::read_into` copies from the surface.

The two 4,128,768-byte framebuffers are the exception to trusting a single replay: one sample of
`synoik-glclient` put them at a hash three later runs did not reproduce, and the pin's value is
what the C leg gives. They are the allocations the settle discussion below is about; a lone
deviation there is a sample, not a regression.

Reaching what is left needs a census that copies out of the `VkImage` rather than out of the
memory, which is guest image-layout tracking on both sides -- see "The census reads the memory, so
an image's texels can escape it" below. Until it exists the pixel gate is the one that settles a
claim about content.

Each context is scored when it is destroyed, and once more at the end if it is still alive. A
workload that exits cleanly frees everything, so scoring only at the end would score nothing.

**`blob` lines score the other half, and the half that outlives the guest.** The census skips an
exported allocation on purpose — its bytes are the blob's, and reporting them under both would read
one buffer twice — so every exporting blob is read separately, through
`virgl_renderer_resource_map`, which is the address the VMM publishes and the guest loads from.
Same sampler, same stability rule, one line per blob: `blob ctx=<c> res=<h> size=<n> read=<n>
hash=<h>`, where `size` is the extent the renderer maps rather than the size the blob was created
for, because a resource that maps short is the divergence worth catching.

It is also the only read that survives the allocation. A host-visible venus allocation owns its
bytes -- minted pages, or the driver's memory and the one mapping over it -- and the blob holds a
*share*, so `vkFreeMemory` retires the record and leaves the mapping good — and every venus corpus reaches that state: measured 2026-09-06, `venus` frees all 26 of its
exported allocations and still has five blobs alive to read at scoring, `synoik-lifecycle` frees
nine. The minted pages are an `mmap` whose last holder `munmap`s them (`GuestMap::drop`), so a
resource that kept the published address without the share would take the replayer down with a
fault on exactly those lines rather than quietly reading stale heap.

Each score is sampled four times, 200 ms apart after a 500 ms lead, and stability is decided per
allocation — see "The census decides stability per allocation" below. The replay skips every ring
flow-control command, so nothing in the stream waits on the GPU: a hash read the instant
`replay_end` returns can race queue work still executing and look nondeterministic when the
renderer is perfectly deterministic.

### Scoring the port against the C

A fixture is recorded from the C, so the gate ladder compares Rust to Rust and a fixture mismatch
means a regression. Reading a Rust score against the *C's* score is a different question, and the
answer is agreement on every census id and size, on every `iosurface backed` count, and on the
hash of everything the paragraph above does not cover. The C leaves *all* host-visible memory to
the driver and publishes the driver's own pointer -- including the declared exports this tree
mints for -- so those entries still compare two allocation models rather than two ports. The
undeclared ones no longer do: both trees read the driver's own memory there.

Equal totals are not agreement. These two censuses once read 22 against 22 while sharing only
twenty entries, because a missing export and a missing import cancelled. Compare the ids, never
the count.

Claims about what a corpus contains are settled against the corpus. That an allocation is an
import was established by printing every allocation's `pNext` verdict during a replay — two
imports in 31 allocations, exactly the two ids in dispute — not by reasoning from the C's source
about which ones ought to be. The same probe is what found four `R8G8B8A8_SRGB` scanouts in a
corpus everything else in it said was BGRA.

Before concluding anything from a hash, compute the all-zero FNV-1a for that read length. Empty
and wrong are different findings and the score does not distinguish them: a refused command leaves
memory no one wrote, and reads as a hash like any other. A scanout export that mints a surface
nothing writes through scores exactly this way, and reports an empty surface as content — which is
worse than reporting nothing. The lengths the corpora actually read:

| bytes | all-zero FNV-1a | | bytes | all-zero FNV-1a |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 65536 | `eb05052ea5b62325` | | 262144 | `9c735bed0a722325` |
| 131072 | `c74b47c8c74a2325` | | 393216 | `156ad9514d9a2325` |
| 196608 | `1a0564b2e8de2325` | | 1048576 | `a96777069d622325` |

Two habits worth keeping. A count that reads zero is worth less than one that reads busy —
`render_pass_starts=0` said neither replay rendered while the allocation-pool counters in the same
log showed real command buffers on both, and the zero was the counter that did not cover the
device. And whole-allocation divergence and partial divergence can share one cause: a refused
command that clears an image leaves it empty, while the same command refused inside a render pass
that other commands did write leaves the allocation merely wrong. Do not read those as two
findings before checking whether one refusal explains both.

### `--smoke`, the skeleton gate

Both replayers take `--smoke`: apply the resource and context events, skip commands, transfers and
the venus replay feed, and exit on whether every create landed. It is what a renderer that has an
ABI, a resource table and a context table — and nothing else yet — can be held to, and it makes
P1's exit condition a command rather than a judgement call.

It refuses `--score`/`--expect`. A smoke score is a strict subset of a real one, so pinning it
would replace a golden with a weaker one that still passes.

Blob creates with a non-zero `blob_id` are skipped and counted: they export an object a command
would have made, and smoke runs no commands. The C renderer fails them in smoke mode too, which is
how we know the bar was in the wrong place rather than the port.

## Conformance vectors (`fluster/`)

Every other gate here is a **differential**: the C's answer is the oracle. That cannot see a
stream both implementations decode wrong, and on the video path the two share a decoder — one
VideoToolbox, reached by two renderers — so a synthesis bug that produces a plausible-but-wrong
parameter set agrees with itself perfectly.

[fluster](https://github.com/fluendo/fluster) closes that. It runs the standards bodies' own
conformance vectors and checks each decoded stream against the **md5 the standards body
published**, which is the only absolute oracle in this tree. `setup.sh` materializes it and the
vectors host-side; `fluster.sh [c|rs|diff]` scores them; `diff` is the gate.

It does not replace the differential, because absolute is not the same as achievable here. This
host advertises HEVC Main and no Main10, and VP9 Profile 0 and nothing else, so streams fail for
reasons that belong to VideoToolbox. **Measured on the C leg: 212 of 305 VP9 vectors match the
published md5**, and the 93 that do not include every `vp90-2-21-resize_inter_*` — mid-stream
resolution changes — and the 8-pixel-wide `vp90-2-02-size-08x*`. So the gate is two claims kept
apart: the legs decode the same set (ours), and the C leg's own set has not moved (the host's).

Unlike `ctests.sh` there is no cascade — each vector is its own process — so the pin is the whole
result list, not its first entry.

**The vectors live on the host and are shared read-only** (`--share fluster=...:ro`, mounted by
hand because the stock guest carries no limina agent). They are several GB against a 13 GB stock
image, and both legs must read the same bytes for a diff between them to mean anything.

**A suite that is not completely downloaded is skipped, not run.** fluster reports an absent
vector as a failure, and pinning that would record the state of a download as though it were the
renderer's answer.

**`www.itu.int` serves the H.264 and HEVC vectors from behind a WAF**, which under load answers
HTTP 200 with a 245-byte "Request Rejected" page instead of the file. fluster stores that and
reports a checksum mismatch — the same message a genuinely changed upstream vector produces, so
it does not distinguish them. Two attempts giving two *different* checksums for one URL does, and
`file` on the archive says HTML outright. The block is by IP and covers the whole host, so no
header or User-Agent gets past it; it clears itself in minutes, and `-j 1` stays under it.
VP9-TEST-VECTORS is on `storage.googleapis.com` and has none of this.

**AV1 is not scored here**, for the reason `vrend-av1.score` is not: without M3-or-later silicon
`vaav1dec` is not even an element. It belongs on the AV1 machine.

A leg is a whole boot — stock guest, all complete suites, poweroff — and costs about 75 seconds
for the 305 VP9 vectors, so this is per-commit work rather than nightly.

**The gate is armed**: inverting the VP9 key-frame flag in `src/vrend/video/mod.rs` takes the rs
leg from 212/305 to **1/305**, and reverting brings it back. The pin currently covers
VP9-TEST-VECTORS alone, because the ITU suites were still downloading when it was recorded —
a whole suite appearing in the pin diff is that, and wants a re-record rather than an
investigation.

### The rig's two legs are built differently, and not by choice

**limina compiles virglrs in.** rutabaga names it as a cargo *path* dependency
(`third_party/libkrun/src/rutabaga_gfx/Cargo.toml`), so `limina-vmm` has no `libvirglrenderer`
load command and there is no dylib for the rs leg to swap. `make-rig.sh --renderer rust`
therefore **builds** its bundle: a `git worktree` of limina at `harness/vm/limina-src`, whose
`third_party/` is symlinks to limina's (it is untracked there, and 14 GB) with **`virglrs`
pointed at this tree**. A worktree and not limina's own checkout, for the reason the rig is a
copy at all — re-pointing theirs would change what their builds compile.

The check that makes this real is `cargo metadata`: the resolved manifest path for `virglrs` must
be the worktree's own, and `make-rig.sh` refuses to build otherwise. A build that merely *ran* is
not evidence — the defect this replaced was a build that ran perfectly against the wrong source.
`harness/vm/Limina-rust.rev` records which limina commit the bundle came from, beside the app
rather than inside it, because build-app.sh seals the bundle.

**The C leg still swaps a dylib**, because the C renderer still is one. Only a limina from
*before* the cutover has a load command to swap into, so `make-rig.sh --renderer c` asserts on it
and refuses a post-cutover bundle: a swap into a bundle that loads nothing would boot virglrs
while reporting as C, and re-sign afterwards so it looked fresh. `harness/vm/Limina.app` is that
pre-cutover bundle, and limina HEAD can no longer produce another.

**So the C leg is a saved artifact, and that is a debt, not a design.** It works — every boot gate
here is scored against it — but it cannot be rebuilt, so it cannot follow a limina fix, and the
day it stops booting there is nothing to regenerate it from.

**The candidate is to move the boot rig to QEMU**, which loads the renderer as a dylib and can
therefore hold *both* implementations without a fork of the VMM between them — the thing limina
structurally cannot do now that it compiles virglrs in. There is already a QEMU control rig on
goiaba, so the shape is known. **Deliberately deferred**: the C leg boots today, and rebuilding
the rig is a larger change than anything currently waiting on it.

## Layer 0 — the ABI itself (`abi/`)

`abi-fixture.sh` pins two files and checks a build against them: `symbols.txt`, the symbols a
dylib must export, and `layout.txt`, the size, alignment and field offsets of every struct that
crosses the ABI. `VIRGL_PREFIX` selects the build under test, so pointing it at a Rust build is
how the port gets checked — the same variable `vrend-replay.sh`, `vkr-replay.sh` and `build.sh`
resolve, so one setting drives every layer at once; `--pin` re-records, and is only for a change to the ABI that is meant.

**The layout is exact and the symbols are a floor**, because the two implementations legitimately
differ: virglrs serves `journal_held` and the C header has no equivalent, so one exact list could
only ever pass one of them. A build is checked for every pinned symbol; anything beyond the floor
is printed by name and is not a failure. `--pin` refuses to record the floor from the Rust build
for the same reason — it would raise the bar to include the extensions, and the next run would
name the C as the regression.

**Which renderer to score is never defaulted.** Both replay wrappers refuse to run until they are
told, by `--renderer rs|c` or by `VIRGL_PREFIX`, and each echoes the prefix it used. A default is
worse than an argument here: picking one silently produces a full, plausible score for whichever
implementation the caller forgot to name, and a score file for the wrong renderer reads exactly
like a regression in the right one.

**No gate here has a manual install step, and adding one to a ladder buys nothing.** A script that
scores `virglrs/prefix` builds and installs it first — `abi-fixture.sh` and `vkr-replay.sh` both
do — so what gets measured is always the tree as it stands. A prefix nobody here owns gets a
staleness warning instead, and the caller decides.

Both failures are invisible to every other layer here. A missing symbol shows up at `dlopen` and
nowhere earlier; a wrong field offset never shows up at all — it compiles clean on both sides and
corrupts at runtime. The layout comes from the compiler (`abi-dump.c`, built against the header),
not from a transcription anyone has to keep in step.

The symbol floor is *everything the C exports*, not the subset libkrun happens to call. Who calls
what is defined outside this tree and moves without warning, so a port that exports the whole list
satisfies every consumer of it — which is also why a symbol beyond the list costs nothing, and why
only a missing one fails.

## The capture rig (`vm/`)

Layers 1 and 2 both need corpora, and a corpus comes from a real guest. `vm/` builds a
self-contained rig — limina's app bundle with this tree's renderer swapped in, plus APFS clones of
an enhanced and a stock disk — so captures never mutate limina's working set. See `vm/README.md`.

## Layer 3 — fuzz corpora and the perf ledger

`tests/test_virgl_*` are not part of the harness. They look ABI-level and are not: every one of
them includes internal headers and links the static library, so none can run against a Rust
dylib. They also need `check` and do not build on this platform. They stay as C-side regression
tests with no role in the rewrite; Layer 2 covers the same ground through the ABI at the same
speed.

`tests/fuzzer/` corpora move to `cargo-fuzz` once the Rust decode paths exist — corpora are data
and survive the language change. Performance is a trend ledger, never a gate — a rewrite regresses
performance invisibly, and gating on it stops work for the wrong reason.

## What the harness owes

Each of these blocks a corpus or makes one unreadable. They are harness defects, not renderer
findings — none of them says anything about virglrs or the C until it is fixed.

**Stable within a run, different between runs, means the fix is upstream of the comparison.**
Never in the settle time. A value the corpus determines converges as you wait; a value it does not
determine settles just as firmly on a different answer each run, and waiting longer only buys a
more confident wrong number. Two oracles here have failed this way, and both times the first
guesses were correlates — a contended host, a cold start — because both make the race easier to
lose without being what loses it. The test that separates them costs one command: sample at two
very different waits. Three waits giving three answers is not a settle problem.

**The census decides stability per allocation, not per context.** Four samples, and an allocation
whose bytes move between them is scored `unstable` with the number of values it took rather than
given a hash. A whole-context settle cannot do this: it can find two passes agreeing early on the
same half-drawn frame and pin that, which is a fixture recording the scheduler rather than the
corpus.

That distinction is what `synoik-glclient` cost to learn. Its two 4,128,768-byte allocations are
the compositor's framebuffers -- 1280x800 BGRA plus padding, and the bytes are pixels -- and under
the old whole-context settle they read differently at 500 ms, 3 s and 8 s. That looked like ring
flow control, which the replay skips: nothing in the stream waits on the GPU, so where the ring
threads come to rest is the scheduler's to say. It was not. The sampler lives in the replayer and
is shared by both legs, which is exactly why the variance appeared on both and looked like a
property of the corpus. Measured 2026-09-05, with per-allocation sampling: 19 replays across both
legs and all three settle leads produce one identical score.

**The two renderers write identical descriptor slots.** Measured 2026-09-05 by tracing every
`vkUpdateDescriptorSets` element on both legs in guest ids — set, binding, array element, type,
count, and the view/sampler/buffer each slot names — across all six venus corpora: 197 elements,
byte-identical. Guest ids and not host handles is the whole trick; the legs mint different handles
for the same object, so a handle trace differs on every line and answers nothing.

It is a bounded negative result, and the bounds are the point. No corpus we hold uses
`vkCmdPushDescriptorSet` (zero occurrences on all six) or descriptor copies, and virglrs implements
no push-descriptor command at all — so a guest that pushes descriptors is unmeasured here, and
diverges. `vkUpdateDescriptorSetWithTemplate` needs no coverage: the C dispatches it to NULL, which
means the guest expands templates before encoding and the plain path is the only path.

**Nothing here scores venus for cost, so a renderer can get quadratically slower and stay green.**
Performance is a trend ledger and never a gate (below), and the ledger has no venus row at all.
What that let through, found on the dogfood and not here: discarding a command buffer's recording
was a linear scan of the whole snapshot journal, run on every `vkBeginCommandBuffer`, on the ring
thread inside the guest's submit path — so it grew with the session and a video decode, which
begins a buffer per frame, drove the worker to 161% CPU against an idle guest. Every correctness
oracle passed throughout, because the renderer was right and only slow.

A unit timing test is not the fix: a threshold tuned tightly enough to catch this is tight enough
to fire on a loaded machine, and the property under test is cost per command, not wall time. What
is owed is a venus row in the ledger — user CPU of `vkr-replay`, read as a trend against the
pinned corpora the scores already use. No new corpus is needed for it: measured 2026-09-08,
`synoik-vkcube` begins 4,568 command buffers over 74,829 commands and `synoik-glclient` 4,426 over
61,260, which is the shape that makes a per-begin scan of a growing journal visible. Read it from
those two and not from `venus.vkrc`, which is much the largest corpus at 578,868 commands and
begins only 436 buffers.

**`vrend-av1.score` is stale.** It predates scoring at the format's own bytes per texel and cannot
be re-recorded here; alface has no AV1 silicon. It has to be redone on couve.

**The census reads the memory, so an image's texels can escape it.** It hashes the allocation's
pages, which is the whole of the truth for a buffer and for a LINEAR image, and none of it for an
OPTIMAL image on KosmicKrisp — the driver keeps those texels in a private texture and the pages
stay zero. Forty-one entries across `synoik` and `synoik-glclient` are pinned at all-zeros for that
reason — every censused allocation on either corpus that is not one of the four IOSurface-backed
scanouts — and a real divergence in any of them would not move the score.

Recovering them means copying out of the `VkImage` — a transfer to a host-visible staging buffer on
a transient command buffer — and two things stand in the way of writing that. The copy needs the
image's current layout, which this renderer does not track: layouts are the guest's, moved by every
barrier, render-pass `finalLayout` and implicit transition, so tracking them is a shadow of
Vulkan's state machine and `UNDEFINED` would discard the texels the census came for. And the gap is
symmetric — `memory_write` restores *pages*, so texels the census cannot see are texels a restore
cannot put back either. A census that read through the image alone would report content the restore
cannot reproduce, which is a stricter gate than the mechanism it gates. Either both sides go
through the image, or neither does — and neither is the decision: census and restore both read and
write pages, the 41 stay a hole, and the pixel gate is what carries those two corpora. Reopening it
means committing to guest image-layout tracking on both sides, not to a census change.
