//! The reply encoder's differential test: encode every recorded command's reply twice -- once with
//! the generated Rust, once with venus-protocol's own generated C -- and compare the bytes.
//!
//! The wire round trip covers the request path for free, because the recorded bytes are mesa's
//! encoder output. No recording contains a reply: both replay entry points call
//! `vkr_replay_strip_reply`, so a replayed stream never asks for one. That leaves the 326
//! per-command reply wrappers with no witness at all, and they are generated -- one template
//! mistake is 326 identical bugs, each of which reaches a guest as plausible garbage rather than
//! as an error.
//!
//! Ground truth is the C renderer encoder because that is what every venus guest in existence
//! decodes. Both sides encode the *same* `vn_command_*`: it is `#[repr(C)]`, so the C reads the
//! memory the Rust decoder filled rather than a second construction of it.
//!
//! A recorded command carries the guest's *request*, so its outputs arrive null or zeroed -- and
//! zero is the value that hides a content mistake, because two encoders reading different members
//! of the same zeroed struct write the same bytes. So the outputs are planted with distinct values
//! before encoding (`proto::fill`), which is what makes a swapped or mis-strided output field show
//! up as a byte difference rather than as agreement.
//!
//! Still out of reach: chained outputs. The fill leaves `pNext` null, because planting one link
//! takes the reachable type set from 42 structs to 235. The null branch is the one a recorded
//! command already exercises.

// The reader is shared with the replayer, which uses more of it than this does.
