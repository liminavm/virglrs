//! Replay a recorded venus corpus into a virglrenderer build, with no VM, no guest and no
//! hypervisor -- harness layer 2 for venus (`harness/README.md`).
//!
//! The corpus is a prologue plus a stream (`src/venus/vkr_record.h`). This drives it through the
//! public C ABI only, so the same binary runs against the C renderer and against virglrs and the
//! two outputs are comparable. That constraint is the whole point of the harness and nothing here
//! may reach around it.
//!
//!   vkr-replay <corpus.vkrc> --renderer <libvirglrenderer.dylib> [--flags N] [--verbose]
//!
//! Exit status is 0 when every record was accepted, 1 when any was rejected or the corpus itself
//! is malformed. A truncated corpus is not a failure: truncation is a prefix, and a prefix replays.
