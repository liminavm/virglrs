"""Normalise a `VREND_DEBUG=shader` log into the shader fixture.

The C prints, per shader created, "TGSI received:" followed by `tgsi_dump` of the tokens it
parsed and "GLSL:" followed by the text it emitted, each fragment prefixed with the context's
name by `vrend_print_context_name`. This strips the prefixes, drops everything that is not one of
those blocks (driver warnings, readback errors), and writes the blocks one after another:

    TGSI received:
    <the dump, one token per line>

    GLSL:
    <the GLSL>

The Rust tests read the fixture and hold the TGSI parser and the translator to it byte for byte.
Record it with the debug C prefix, which is the only one that compiles the dump in:

    VIRGL_PREFIX=.../harness/vm/prefix-debug VREND_DEBUG=shader \\
        ./vrend-replay.sh ../vm/captures/vrend.bin --renderer c --score /dev/null 2> shader.log
    ./vrend-shader-log.py shader.log > fixtures/vrend-shaders.txt

The Rust prefix prints the same blocks under `VIRGLRS_DEBUG=shader`, with the mark on its own
line already; this reads either, so the two runs diff after the same pass.
