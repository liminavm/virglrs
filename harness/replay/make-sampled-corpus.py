# Write a synthetic classic corpus for the blits whose destination the replay sweep cannot read.
#
#   make-sampled-corpus.py [OUT]      default ../vm/captures/sampled.bin
#
# The sweep scores a resource only when it is `target == 2 && format != 20 && width > 8` -- a
# plain 2D colour offscreen. A blit into a layer of an array, or out of one slice of a 3D
# texture, has no line in any score: the corpus would replay green while measuring nothing. So
# every destination here is read by SAMPLING it in a draw whose own destination is a plain 2D
# offscreen, which the sweep does read. The draw is the oracle; `make-blit-corpus.py` holds the
# blits that need none.
#
# Why not read the array directly instead. The oracle has to be a DIFFERENT mechanism from the
# one under test, or two wrongs cancel: a blit that writes the wrong layer, read back by a copy
# that reads the wrong layer, hashes exactly like a correct pair. A draw that names its layer in
# a texture coordinate does not share the blitter's attachment path, and every layer this corpus
# does not blit into carries its own distinct fill, so a blit that lands in the wrong one is
# visible from both ends.
