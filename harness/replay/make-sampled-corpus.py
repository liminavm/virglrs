# Write a synthetic classic corpus for the blits whose destination the replay sweep cannot read.

#
# The sweep scores a resource only when it is `target == 2 && format != 20 && width > 8` -- a
# plain 2D colour offscreen. A blit into a layer of an array, or out of one slice of a 3D
# texture, has no line in any score: the corpus would replay green while measuring nothing. So
# every destination here is read by SAMPLING it in a draw whose own destination is a plain 2D
# offscreen, which the sweep does read. The draw is the oracle; `make-blit-corpus.py` holds the
# blits that need none.
#
# Why not read the array directly instead. The oracle has to be a DIFFERENT mechanism from the
# one under test, or two wrongs cancel: a blit that writes the wrong layer, read back by a copy
# that reads the wrong layer, hashes exactly like a correct pair. A draw that names its layer in
# a texture coordinate does not share the blitter's attachment path, and every layer this corpus
# does not blit into carries its own distinct fill, so a blit that lands in the wrong one is
# visible from both ends.

    # attach lands every pixel in layer 0. X -> A forces the blitter (the two ends' table
    # swizzles disagree, so no framebuffer blit can serve it).

    # --- the 3D source ---
    # A blit out of one slice of an eight-slice 3D texture. The blitter normalises the slice by
    # the source TEXTURE's depth, not by the box's: dividing by the box makes every sub-range
    # blit sample the wrong slice. Two slices, because a wrong divisor can land on the right
    # slice for one z by coincidence and never for two.
    VOL_SRC = 40
    VOL_READ_5, VOL_READ_1 = 41, 42

    # --- what a blit leaves on its source's texture object ---
    # The blitter samples its source through the source's OWN texture object, and writes that
    # object's swizzle, base and max level, filters and wrap modes to suit itself. The sampler
    # view bind is cached on the view handle, so re-binding the identical view after a blit
    # re-applies none of them. On the reading, the next draw samples through the blitter's
    # settings. Two draws through one view, identical in every respect, with a blit between:
    # what the second reads settles it.
    #
    # The two implementations disagree, and the C is the one that is wrong. virglrs reads the
    # same pixels twice, which is the only answer two identical draws with nothing between them
    # can have. The C's second read comes back byte-identical to the blit's DESTINATION --
    # identity swizzle, alpha forced to one, exactly what `vrend_set_tex_param` wrote -- so the
    # blitter's settings reached a draw that never asked for them.
    #
    # So this is the one fixture in the tree whose golden is not the C: pinning the C here would
    # mean reproducing a bug in code already written correctly, and a permanently red line is a
    # gate nobody reads. The deviation is in `docs/rust-rewrite.md`.
    #
    # The observable has to be the SWIZZLE, which is a finding and not a preference. A view that
    # restricts levels is backed by a GL texture view carrying its own parameters, so the
    # blitter's writes land on the parent and no draw through that view could see them whatever
    # happened. Filters and wrap are no better: those come from the bound sampler object, which
    # overrides the texture's. Only the swizzle is a parameter both ends write on the same
    # object, and only a full-range view has no view object in between.
    #
    # What shields virglrs is not established, and these lines do not depend on it. They pin the
    # invariant, so if a driver or a change to the view cache ever lets the write through, the
    # score moves and says so.
