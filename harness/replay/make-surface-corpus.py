# Write a synthetic classic corpus that destroys a surface the framebuffer is still using.
#
#   make-surface-corpus.py [OUT]      default ../vm/captures/surface.bin
#
# A surface whose format reinterprets its resource is backed by a GL texture view, and that view
# has to outlive the surface object the guest destroys -- the framebuffer goes on naming it until
# the next SET_FRAMEBUFFER_STATE. No recorded corpus does this: a GNOME session destroys its
# surfaces only after unbinding them, so the ordering that matters is never sampled and a renderer
# that deletes the view at DESTROY_OBJECT scores green everywhere.
#
# Both cases here are scored by clearing to a flat colour after the destroy and reading the
# resource back. The resource is pre-filled with a pattern, so a clear that lands nowhere is a
# different hash from a clear that lands -- and neither is the uninitialised storage that would
# make the fixture unpinnable.
#
#   destroy-then-clear   The plain lifetime: the surface goes away, the framebuffer slot does not.
#   destroy-then-rebind  A second surface created under the same handle. The bind path compares
#                        the slot against the handle it is asked for, so a stale slot value can
#                        skip a re-attach that has to happen -- the new surface's view is a
#                        different texture from the dead one's.
