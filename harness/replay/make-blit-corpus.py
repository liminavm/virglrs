# Write a synthetic classic corpus whose every BLIT needs the shader blitter.
#
#   make-blit-corpus.py [OUT]      default ../vm/captures/blit.bin
#
# The recorded corpora do not reach the blitter. A GNOME session's blits are all format-matched
# mip-chain reductions, which take glBlitFramebuffer; replaying the classic corpus with the
# blitter's variants counted prints nothing. So a port of the blitter could be scored green by
# every pinned fixture in the tree while doing nothing at all, and the gate has to be built
# before the code it gates.
#
# Each blit here is a destination that only the blitter can fill. The reason is always
# `needs_swizzle` or `needs_redblue_swizzle` -- the two predicates in `vrend_renderer_blit_int`
# that a synthetic corpus can force without a draw:
#
#   swizzle    An X-channel format is an RGBA texture with a texture swizzle of (X,Y,Z,1) on it,
#              so a blit between the A and the X spelling of one layout has ends whose swizzles
#              disagree. A framebuffer blit reads the storage and would carry the wrong alpha.
#   redblue    An IOSurface-backed BGRA resource cannot be viewed, so a blit that names it in the
#              opposite channel order has to swap red and blue in the shader.
#
# What is deliberately NOT here: the depth-writing variants (`blit_build_frag_depth`). The score
# reads back colour offscreens, so a depth destination would sit in the corpus looking covered
# while measuring nothing. They need a corpus that samples the blitted depth into a colour
# target, which needs shaders, which is a different corpus.
#
# Sources are filled by RESOURCE_INLINE_WRITE rather than TRANSFER3D: the bytes travel in the
# command stream, so the corpus needs no iov and no XFERDATA records to be replayable.
#
# Every destination is exactly the size of the region its blit writes. The score reads a whole
# resource back, so a destination larger than its blit would carry uninitialised storage into the
# hash -- which is not a pinnable number: two runs of the C alone disagree on it.
