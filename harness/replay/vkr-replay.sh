# Replay a venus corpus against a renderer build, with no VM.
#
#   vkr-replay.sh <corpus.vkrc> --renderer rs|c|<libvirglrenderer.dylib> [replayer options]
#
# --score <file> writes the score; --expect <file> compares against a pinned one and exits
# non-zero on any difference. The score is renderer state, not pixels: a VM-free replay has no
# scanout, so what it compares is the accept counts and the device memory the commands left.
#
# Which renderer to run is mandatory: --renderer rs (the Rust tree) or c (the reference C), or a
# dylib path of your own, or VIRGL_PREFIX set to a prefix. There is deliberately no default. A
# wrapper that picks one silently scores whichever renderer the caller forgot to name, and the
# result is a full, plausible score file for the wrong implementation -- which reads exactly like
# a regression in the one you meant. Running both against one corpus is the entire reason this
# layer exists, so naming which is not a burden.
#
# venus needs a host Vulkan driver and nothing else: no EGL, no GL, no winsys. On macOS that is
# KosmicKrisp, taken from the same Mesa prefix the renderer was built against.
