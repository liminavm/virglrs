# Replay a classic (vrend) corpus against a renderer build, with no VM.
#
#   vrend-replay.sh <corpus.bin> --renderer rs|c [replayer options]
#
# Which renderer to run is mandatory: pass --renderer rs (the Rust tree) or --renderer c (the
# reference C), or set VIRGL_PREFIX to a prefix yourself. There is deliberately no default. A
# wrapper that picks one silently scores whichever renderer the caller forgot to name, and the
# result is a full, plausible score file for the wrong implementation -- which reads exactly like
# a regression in the one you meant.
#
# The environment is the point of this wrapper. vrend runs on zink over KosmicKrisp through an
# epoxy built WITH EGL, and none of that is on the default loader path: a golden recorded under an
# environment that lives in someone's shell history is not reproducible. Set MESA_PREFIX or
# EPOXY_PREFIX to move either one.
#
# --score <file> writes the score; --expect <file> compares against a pinned one and exits
# non-zero. The score is the readback sequence -- content hashes and ink counts, in stream order
# -- plus the run counters, so diff is the whole comparison tool.
