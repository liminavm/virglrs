// Replay a captured vrend command stream through libvirglrenderer on the HOST, with no VM.
//
// This is harness layer 2 (docs/rust-rewrite.md): a VM-free vehicle that drives only the public
// ABI, so the same corpus runs against the C renderer and against virglrs and the outputs are
// comparable. A replay costs seconds where a boot costs minutes, which is what makes a rewrite
// testable at subagent speed.
//
// INPUT is a dump from vrend's in-memory tracer (LIMINA_VREND_TRACE, src/vrend/vrend_trace.[ch]):
// submit boundaries, every decoded command with its full payload, the bytes each guest->host
// transfer carried, and an ordered resource create/blob/unref log in a never-evicted side store.
// The replayer needs no blob or iov machinery of its own — it hands every resource a plain
// malloc'd iov and memcpys the recorded bytes in before the batch that reads them.
//
// ORACLE. Each scored resource is read back through transfer_read_iov and reported as an FNV-1a
// hash plus an ink count; REPLAY_DUMP_DIR additionally writes the raw pixels and a manifest.
// The hash line is the golden: record it from the C build, diff it against virglrs.
//
//   vrend-replay <dump> [--ctx N] [--loops N] [--nodraw] [--readback RES] [--sweep]
//
//   --ctx N       which virgl context to replay (default: the one with the most records)
//   --loops N     replay the captured stream N times (default 1)

//                 score -- the resources that lose their ink are the ones drawing reaches, and an
//                 empty diff means the oracle is measuring nothing.
//   --readback R  score only this resource (default: every colour offscreen, at its unref)
//   --sweep       score every colour offscreen at its unref -- the default
//   --sweep-w W   restrict --sweep to targets of this width
//   --score F     write the score to F
//   --expect F    compare the score against F and exit non-zero on any difference

// Env: REPLAY_DUMP_DIR (raw BGRA + manifest.txt), REPLAY_DUMP_W, REPLAY_NO_UNREF.
