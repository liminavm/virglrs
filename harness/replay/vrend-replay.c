// Replay a captured vrend command stream through libvirglrenderer on the HOST, with no VM.
//
// This is harness layer 2 (docs/rust-rewrite.md): a VM-free vehicle that drives only the public
// ABI, so the same corpus runs against the C renderer and against virglrs and the outputs are
// comparable. A replay costs seconds where a boot costs minutes, which is what makes a rewrite
// testable at subagent speed.
//
// INPUT is a dump from vrend's in-memory tracer (LIMINA_VREND_TRACE, src/vrend/vrend_trace.[ch]):
// submit boundaries, every decoded command with its full payload, the bytes each guest->host
// transfer carried, and an ordered resource create/blob/unref log in a never-evicted side store.
// The replayer needs no blob or iov machinery of its own — it hands every resource a plain
// malloc'd iov and memcpys the recorded bytes in before the batch that reads them.
//
// ORACLE. Each scored resource is read back through transfer_read_iov and reported as an FNV-1a
// hash plus an ink count; REPLAY_DUMP_DIR additionally writes the raw pixels and a manifest.
// The hash line is the golden: record it from the C build, diff it against virglrs.
//
//   vrend-replay <dump> [--ctx N[,N...]] [--loops N] [--nodraw] [--nofeed] [--readback RES] [--sweep]
//
//   --ctx N[,N]   which virgl contexts to replay (default: the one with the most records).
//                 A list, because one workload can span contexts that only make sense
//                 together -- a video player draws in one and decodes in another, and
//                 either alone replays half the operation.
//   --loops N     replay the captured stream N times (default 1)
//   --nofeed      positive control for blob content: land the recorded bytes in the backing
//                 store as usual, but never carry them into the texture. What inks a blob's
//                 window then is the renderer reading the guest's pages for itself, which is
//                 the whole of the import path -- and with the feed on, a renderer that reads
//                 nothing scores exactly like one that reads correctly.
//   --nodraw      positive control: drop every DRAW_VBO. Score it and diff against the ordinary
//                 score -- the resources that lose their ink are the ones drawing reaches, and an
//                 empty diff means the oracle is measuring nothing.
//   --readback R  score only this resource (default: every colour offscreen, at its unref)
//   --sweep       score every colour offscreen at its unref -- the default
//   --no-zero-new leave a new resource's contents undefined instead of zeroing them, which is
//                 how to see what an unwritten resource was reading. Goldens are recorded with
//                 the zeroing ON, so a score line is the renderer's answer and not its allocator's.
//   --sweep-w W   restrict --sweep to targets of this width
//   --score F     write the score to F
//   --expect F    compare the score against F and exit non-zero on any difference
//   --rebuild-score F   write the rebuild report -- entries in and out per context, and every
//                 entry the rebuild could not use -- to F
//   --rebuild-expect F  compare that report against F. Without it, a rebuild that loses an entry
//                 fails; with it, the pinned losses are the ones this corpus is known to make
//   --caps F      write the classic capsets (VIRGL and VIRGL2) the renderer fills, one field a
//                 line, to F and exit. Record it from the C, diff it against virglrs: the guest's
//                 driver configures itself from nothing else.
//
// Env: REPLAY_DUMP_DIR (raw BGRA + manifest.txt), REPLAY_DUMP_W, REPLAY_NO_UNREF.

 * line, so it disturbs nothing any renderer actually draws. On the VP9 corpus it moves 224
 * resources -- decode target planes the guest allocates and never decodes into -- and with it on
 * the two renderers agree on every one of them, where before they disagreed on 22. --no-zero-new
