# Basemark Web 3.0 graphics suite on the stock guest, driven rather than clicked, because the
# sample has to be aimed: the suite is seven short tests in sequence, and a profile that smears
# across several of them cannot be attributed to any one.
#
# What this prints to stdout, interleaved and timestamped, is the whole point -- the host samples
# the vmm in parallel and the two logs are correlated afterwards. Nothing here renders a verdict.
#
# The trap this shares with client-gl-synoik.sh, and the reason that script exists: an SSH shell
# does not have the session's GL environment. Without it Firefox falls back to llvmpipe -- it
# draws, the benchmark completes, it reports a score, and the renderer under test never sees a
# command. That profile reads as "no hotspot", which is the most misleading result available, so
# the renderer is asserted below and a fallback refuses the run rather than scoring it.

# suite=2 is the Graphics suite alone: WebGL 1.0.2, WebGL 2.0, Shader Pipeline, Draw-call Stress,
# Geometry Stress, Canvas, SVG. Per-test selection is a Corporate-version feature, so the suite is
# the finest cut available -- which is exactly the seven tests we care about.
# Community mode is ACTIVATED at the root and persists in the profile; it is not a query parameter
# that /run/ understands on its own. A fresh profile each run means activating each run, so this is
# loaded first and its only job is to leave that state behind. Skipping it leaves the suite sitting
# behind a Start button while the profile records an idle desktop.
#
# Every option is set HERE, on the root, and none of them are understood by /run/. Community mode
# prints its own configuration to the console, and that block -- not the URL we asked for -- is
# what says which suite is about to run. It is asserted below, because a suite=2 that silently
# stayed "All suites" scores the JS tests too and costs eight minutes to discover.
