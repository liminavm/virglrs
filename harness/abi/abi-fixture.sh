# Pin, and check, the C ABI: the symbols the dylib exports and the layout of every struct that
# crosses it. Both are things a Rust port declares by hand on its own side, and both fail in a way
# nothing else in the harness sees -- a missing symbol only shows at dlopen, a wrong offset never
# shows at all, it just corrupts.
#
#   abi-fixture.sh            check the current build against the pinned fixtures
#   abi-fixture.sh --pin      re-record them (do this only when the ABI is meant to change)
#
# VIRGL_PREFIX selects the build under test; it defaults to this tree's rig prefix, so pointing it
# at a Rust build is how the port gets checked.
