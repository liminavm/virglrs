//! The Vulkan driver, reached through the Khronos loader.
//!
//! One of the named unsafe modules (CLAUDE.md): every call into a driver is an FFI call, and this
//! is where they are wrapped so the rest of the renderer is safe Rust.
//!
//! **The loader is mandatory, and it is linked rather than dlopened.** KosmicKrisp is a pure ICD:
//! it exports `vk_icdGetInstanceProcAddr` and `vk_icdNegotiateLoaderICDInterfaceVersion` and
//! nothing else, so there is no `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` to find in it and no way to reach it
//! except through the loader. Linking rather than dlopening is limina's constraint, not a
//! preference: the worker is codesigned, the hardened runtime strips `DYLD_*` from its
//! environment, and `/opt/homebrew/lib` is not on dyld's default path -- so a bare-name dlopen
//! finds nothing and venus enumerates zero GPUs. Which driver runs is then the loader's ICD
//! selection, which is per-process and finer-grained than any build flag.
//!
//! **The tables are generated, not written.** `proc` comes out of the same vk.xml the serializer
//! does, so a command's arguments go from the wire into the driver with no conversion and no
//! second set of signatures to keep in step. That is what `ash` would have cost: a parallel type
//! universe, an unchecked assumption that its layouts match ours, and no answer at all for MESA's
//! venus-private commands.
