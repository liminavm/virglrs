//! The C ABI shim: all 69 exported symbols, and the one place global state is allowed.

//! The C ABI has no handle for the renderer -- `virgl_renderer_init` initializes "the" renderer
//! and every later call addresses it implicitly. That implicit global has to live somewhere, and
//! this is it: ONE `static`, holding ONE owned root, in the module whose job is the ABI. It is not
//! a licence for a habit. Nothing outside this file reaches a global, and the native crate that
//! replaces this shim will hand the root out as a value instead.
//!
//! Every function here is a boundary against a guest, so every one of them validates rather than
//! asserting: a bad handle, an unknown context or a null pointer is rejected with an error code.
//! Asserts belong behind this line, on invariants we control.
//!
//! The exports are declared safe and dereference caller-supplied pointers, which is normally a
//! lint. It is the correct shape here and the allow is module-wide rather than per-function: the
//! contract is the C ABI's, identical for all 69, and stating it once is what keeps it readable.
//! The caller is the VMM, which owns every pointer it passes for the duration of the call.
