//! Gallium's vocabulary, as the classic wire spells it.
//!
//! The guest's driver is a gallium driver, and every enumerated field on the classic wire is a
//! `pipe_*` value written as an integer. The C reads them back as integers and translates each to
//! GL at the point of use, through switches whose `default:` is an `assert(0)` -- so a guest that
//! writes a blend factor of 0 crashes the host. Here each vocabulary is an enum, parsed once at the
//! decoder and refused there, and the rest of vrend only ever sees a value that exists.
//!
//! Values are gallium's own (`p_defines.h`), because the wire is defined by them: renumbering one
//! would silently change what a guest's stream means.

/// How many slots of each kind a gallium context has (`p_state.h`), which is the same number
/// three ways: what the decoder admits from the guest, what the state a stage carries is sized
/// for, and what the capset advertises. Each is one constant here, because a decoder that admits
/// a slot the state cannot hold drops it silently, and a capset that advertises more than the
/// decoder admits invites a guest to be refused for taking us at our word.
