//! The shader blitter: a blit no framebuffer blit can do, done as a textured quad.
//!
//! `glBlitFramebuffer` reads a framebuffer's storage and writes another's. That is the wrong
//! operation whenever the two ends disagree about what their storage *means* -- an X-channel
//! format whose alpha is a texture swizzle rather than a stored byte, an IOSurface-backed BGRA
//! texture whose red and blue arrive the other way round, a colourspace one end converts and the
//! other does not. Each of those is a per-texel function, so it belongs in a fragment shader, and
//! this module is that shader plus the one quad it runs on.
//!
//! It renders in its own GL context, shared with the renderer's, exactly as the C's does. That is
//! not an implementation detail to tidy away: the blit sets a program, a framebuffer, a vertex
//! array, a viewport and the depth state, and doing that in the calling sub-context would
//! invalidate every piece of state the draw path tracks. A separate context means the caller's
//! state is untouched and its dirty masks stay true. The caller's context is made current again
//! before the blit returns, because the commands after a `BLIT` in the same batch do not ask.
//!
//! The C's blit context is a file-scope static; here it hangs off the renderer root and is built
//! on the first blit that needs it.
