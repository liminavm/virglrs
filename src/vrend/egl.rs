//! EGL: the winsys the classic renderer draws through.
//!
//! One of the named unsafe modules (CLAUDE.md). libEGL is linked, not dlopened -- the argument is
//! `vulkan.rs`'s, unchanged -- and `eglGetProcAddress` is the one symbol taken from it: every EGL
//! and GLES entry point is resolved through it into a table generated from the Khronos registry.
//!
//! The display is surfaceless: there is no window and never will be, because what a guest sees is
//! an IOSurface a compositor presents (`metal.rs`), and vrend renders into textures that are
//! imported from those. So the platform is `EGL_PLATFORM_SURFACELESS_MESA`, every context is
//! made current with no surface, and the config is a formality the API insists on.
//!
//! What this module hands the rest of vrend is a [`Winsys`] that owns the display, [`Context`]s
//! that cannot outlive it, and a [`Gles`] table loaded once a context is current. Nothing else
//! sees an `EGLDisplay` or an `EGLContext`.
