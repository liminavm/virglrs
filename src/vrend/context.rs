//! A classic context: its sub-contexts, what each has bound, and every command a guest can send
//! into one.
//!
//! The C keeps this as `vrend_context` and `vrend_sub_context`. Each sub-context owns a GL
//! context in ctx0's share group, an object table, and a copy of every piece of state the guest
//! last set; a command runs on the current sub-context and touches nothing else. What is
//! emitted to GL immediately and what is only recorded follows the C exactly, because pixels
//! come out of the order GL sees things in -- the notes behind each handler name the C function
//! it mirrors.
//!
//! Errors are one sticky fault. The C reports most of them without stopping the batch and
//! refuses the *next* submission; here the batch stops at the fault and this submission is the
//! one refused. Nothing a guest sends reaches an `assert`: a handle that is not in the table, a
//! resource the context does not have, a shape the host cannot serve -- each is a [`Fault`].
