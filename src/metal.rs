//! IOSurfaces: the only currency a macOS host has for handing pixels to another process.

//! There is no dma-buf here. A scanout blob's storage is an IOSurface, the supervisor composites
//! from it without a copy, and a guest's `VkImage` is imported *over* it -- which is why this
//! module mints them rather than asking Vulkan for one. It has to: KosmicKrisp supports
//! `VK_EXT_external_memory_metal`, so it will import an IOSurface, but not `VK_EXT_metal_objects`,
//! so no `VkImage` can produce one. The surface is the host's to create and the guest's to render
//! into.
//!
//! One of the named unsafe modules (CLAUDE.md). The unsafe here is entirely foreign calls into
//! IOSurface and CoreFoundation, and the invariant it all rests on is refcounting: this module
//! owns exactly the references it took, and [`Surface`] is what makes owning them a type rather
//! than a discipline.
//!
//! **An id is worth nothing after its surface dies.** Ids are recycled immediately, so a stored
//! one names a stranger's surface as soon as ours is freed, and releasing a stranger's surface
//! frees storage its owner cannot re-mint. Nothing here stores an id: [`Surface::id`] asks the
//! live surface every time, and there is no way to name a surface except by holding one.
//!
//! Metal is here for one question: the row pitch a linear Metal texture of a given width takes.
//! The venus scanout path never asks it -- its pitch is the driver's own
//! `VkSubresourceLayout::rowPitch` for the image the surface will back -- but a classic scanout
//! has no `VkImage` to ask, and the importer that will one day lay a linear image over its bytes
//! computes its pitch from exactly this alignment. That one Objective-C message lives here and
//! nowhere else.
