//! The venus renderer root.
//!
//! The C runs vkr behind the render-server proxy (`server/render_state.c`), which is a lock and a
//! forward to `vkr_renderer_*` in the same process. None of that survives here: vkr is an object
//! the `Renderer` owns, reached through it, with no file-scope state and no proxy hop. The C's
//! `vkr_renderer.h` is the interface this mirrors -- that header, not the proxy, is the design.
//!
//! # Lock order
//!
//! Once rings run on their own threads, three locks exist and every path takes them in this order:
//!
//! 1. the resource table (`Renderer::resources`, a read-write lock),
//! 2. one context (`Vkr::contexts`, a mutex each -- so two contexts' rings never wait on each other),
//! 3. the unimplemented-command census (`Vkr::todo`).
//!
//! The park mutex inside a `RingThread` is a leaf: nothing is taken while it is held.
//!
//! A caller arriving through the ABI blocks at each step, because it must run the command it was
//! given. A ring thread never blocks on any of them -- it tries, and a miss is `Verdict::Busy`,
//! retried on the next turn of its loop. That asymmetry is what makes stopping a ring safe:
//! `vkDestroyRingMESA` runs inside a dispatch that already holds the context lock and then joins
//! the thread, so a thread that could block on that lock would deadlock with its own destroy.
