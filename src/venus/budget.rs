//! What the guest has made this process hold, and the cap on it.
//!
//! Every allocation venus makes on the guest's behalf lands in the *renderer's* address space,
//! where the guest's own accounting cannot see it: a guest that leaks `VkDeviceMemory` grows the
//! host worker, not itself. On macOS that ends with the kernel picking the worker as the largest
//! compressed process and killing it -- the whole VM, no guest backtrace, no crash report, at a
//! moment unrelated to the allocation that caused it. Measured 2026-08-06: a Vulkan compositor
//! re-allocated a 4K backdrop instead of reusing it, ~51 GB/hour, and jetsam took the VM at 142 GB.
//!
//! Accounting is always on and enforcement is opt-in, because the two answer different questions.
//! The ledger alone says *which* allocation is growing -- one repeated call site reads as
//! "767 x 31.6 MiB device memory" in a single line -- and it is also the only thing that separates
//! a guest leak from ours: a flat ledger under a climbing process footprint means the leak is in
//! this renderer's release path.
//!
//! **A refusal has to kill the context, because nothing else reaches the guest.** venus allocates
//! asynchronously: mesa's `vn_device_memory_alloc_simple` submits `vkAllocateMemory` and returns
//! `VK_SUCCESS` as soon as the command is on the ring, and `vn_device_memory_wait_alloc` waits on
//! a ring seqno without ever reading a `VkResult` back. The answer is discarded. Stopping the
//! context is not the consolation prize either: a host allocation failure already kills it today,
//! by leaving the guest a handle to memory that was never created and poisoning the ring on the
//! next command that names it. Doing it deliberately closes the window and puts the reason in the
//! log. `ret` is still set, because it is correct under `VN_PERF=no_async_mem_alloc` and costs
//! nothing.
//!
//! **A charge is a value, and crediting it is dropping it.** [`Charge`] lives in the record of
//! whatever it paid for, so every path that retires that record -- a free, a device teardown, a
//! context destroy -- credits the ledger without knowing the ledger exists. There is no release
//! call site to forget, which is the whole reason this is not a pair of `charge`/`credit`
//! functions: a ledger with manual credits has one more place to be wrong every time a new
//! destroy path is added.
//!
//! **Who is charged is structural, not ambient.** The C binds the billing context to the calling
//! *thread*, so an allocation made deeper in the stack attributes to whoever that thread served
//! last -- which is why it also needs a pseudo-context for vrend. Here the context is an argument,
//! because the caller always has one, and there is nothing for a second caller to get wrong.
