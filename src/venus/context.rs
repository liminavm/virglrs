//! A submission is a stream of commands, not one command. The loop mirrors
//! `vkr_context_submit_cmd`: clear the per-command poison, dispatch, and stop the whole batch the
//! moment the stream itself becomes untrustworthy. The distinction is the point -- a lost command
//! costs the guest one operation, a poisoned context costs it the ring, and only the second one
