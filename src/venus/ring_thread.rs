//! The ring loop: one thread per ring, draining what the guest wrote.
//!
//! A ring exists so the guest can hand work over without a VM exit. It writes commands into shared
//! memory and advances a tail; a host thread notices and runs them. Nothing here talks to the VMM,
//! which is the whole point -- the doorbell is a fallback for a ring that has gone to sleep.
//!
//! # Why this module owns almost nothing
//!
//! The C runs `vn_dispatch_command` on the ring thread against the context every other thread is
//! also using, with no lock over the object table or the driver. That is where the data races this
//! rewrite exists to remove actually live, and it cannot be ported.
//!
//! So the thread here does not dispatch. It owns exactly what it can own alone -- the ring's
//! memory, its position in the buffer, its reply slot -- copies each batch out of guest memory, and
//! hands the bytes to a [`Dispatch`] seam that takes whatever lock the renderer needs. The seam is
//! a trait for two reasons: this module never learns what a context is, and the loop is testable
//! without a Vulkan driver anywhere near it.
//!
//! # The rule the whole design rests on
//!
//! **The ring thread never blocks on a lock.** [`Dispatch::try_dispatch`] may answer
//! [`Verdict::Busy`], which is not an error -- it is one more turn of the backoff ladder the loop
//! was going to take anyway.
//!
//! That is what makes stopping safe. `vkDestroyRingMESA` runs *inside* a dispatch, holding the very
//! lock the thread would want, and then has to join this thread. If the thread could block on that
//! lock the two would deadlock. Because it cannot, a stopping thread is always somewhere it can
//! reach its own stop check -- spinning, sleeping, copying, or parked on its own condvar -- and the
//! join completes. Nothing in this loop may acquire a lock by waiting for it.
