//! The venus snapshot journal: what a context has to be told again to be itself.
//!
//! A context's host-side world is not a thing that can be copied — it is Vulkan objects inside a
//! driver we do not own. What *can* be copied is the guest's own words for building it, so the
//! journal keeps the wire bytes of every command that still describes live state, and a restore
//! replays them through the ordinary decoder. Guest-assigned object ids make that id-faithful:
//! the rebuilt world answers to the same names the guest still holds.
//!
//! **An entry lives exactly as long as what it is about.** Every entry names the objects it
//! describes by [`ObjectKey`], and a key to a destroyed object stops resolving on its own — so a
//! destroy prunes nothing, a cascading destroy prunes nothing, and there is no destroy site that
//! can be forgotten. This is where the C's journal spends most of its size: an explicit prune on
//! removal, a pin/unpin protocol so a blob's memory can outlive its free, and a `noted_multi_key`
//! counter for the times its "prune when ANY key dies" rule is a guess. None of that has anything
//! to do here.
//!
//! **Except in one direction, which is not liveness but reachability.** A create may name objects
//! it does not own: a pipeline names its layout and its shader modules, and the guest may destroy
//! a shader module the moment the pipeline exists. The pipeline's create still has to replay, so
//! the module's create has to survive its object. Entries therefore record what they *referenced*
//! as well as what they are about, and the export takes the closure: a retained entry drags in the
//! creates of everything it named, alive or not. The C reaches the same place by pinning at
//! create time and unpinning at destroy; taking the closure once, at export, needs no protocol and
//! cannot leak a pin.
